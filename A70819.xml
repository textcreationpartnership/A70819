            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

out, and here ſet down the ſeverall opinions of note and eſtimation, which are <hi>five</hi> in number; theſe I have examined and compared toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                     <p>In foure of the five I doe finde and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſome parts and pieces of truth, (for no probable Doctrine can ſubſiſt all of falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods) but mingled with ſuch defects, as they ſeeme to me to lead both into error in Faith, and into corruption of manners, if men ſhould live after them, and that not by abuſe only (as may be pretended,) but by juſt and neceſſary conſequence, and by the nature of the very Principles.</p>
                     <p>But in the <hi>fifth opinion,</hi> (I will not ſay there ſhineth forth the perfection of the full and naked truth, for ſince we ſee now <hi>per ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum, in aenigmate,</hi> if I ſhould ſay <hi>Nudam ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem videmus, nihil eſſet coecius iſta arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantia viſionis)</hi> yet this I ſay, there ſeemeth <note place="margin">Aug. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 150.</note> to appeare a certaine way of apprehending, and of teaching this high myſterie, ſuch as is farre more free from occaſion of error, either in faith, or in life, that may ariſe as from it ſelf, than in any other forme of the foure formerly delivered.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Explication</hi> whereof, to make it <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible,</hi> it being (though not new in it ſelfe,) but little opened or touched in Engliſh or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Bookes or Sermons, (unleſſe it be to

                     <p>And as to my Opinions which unexamined may be preſumed to be nothing elſe but either ancient or late condemn'd Hereſies, (which imputation or very ſuppoſition no good man ought to beare with ſilence) theſe leaves do undertake to ſhew, that the apprehenſions expreſſed in them, are none of thoſe old con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned Hereſies, nor of thoſe late rejected Heterodoxes, but the very Doctrine of the ancient Fathers of the Church, builded upon the ſenſe and letter of the holy Scriptures, and conſonant to the publike eſtabliſh'd Doctrine of the Church of England, contained in the bookes of Articles, Common Prayer, and Homilies, which if I ſhall make good by cleare and undeniable evidence, then I hope my good friends will hold me excuſed, and cleared of any ſuch crime as Hereſie, or ſemi-hereſie, or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64487:9"/>
novelty, and will take me for a true and ſound member of the Church of England, both in Doctrine and in Diſcipline: from both which I feare there hath been made by many in this Church too great a defection and departure, ſince the dayes of King <hi>Edw.</hi> the 6. when they were first establiſhed; and ſince the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive years of the happy reigne of Queen <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,</hi> wherein they were ratifyed and ſtrengthened, with a ſecond, and oft-renewed judgement. But the examination and tryall of all this, I commit and ſubmit to my inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous and loving friends, and them and their ſtudies to the goodneſſe and grace of God our Father.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. <hi>That God from all eternity decreed to create a certain number of Men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>That of this number he Predeſtinated ſome to everlaſting life, and other ſome he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated to eternall death.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>That in this act he reſpected nothing more than his own dominion, and the pleaſure of his own will.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>That to bring men to theſe ends, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to permit Sin to enter in upon all men, that the Reprobate might be condemned for ſinne; and that he decreed to ſend his Sonne to recover out of ſin his Elect, fallen together with the Reprobate.</hi>

                        <p>Yet this Opinion doth well admoniſh us to remember the Dominion and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne power and will of God which muſt be ſeen and acknowledged in his predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating of men, according to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 21. <hi>Hath not the Potter power over the clay?</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. <hi>Hee hath mercy on whom he will:</hi> which we will be mindfull of in the fifth Opinion.</p>

                           <p>For the words of theſe foure, they are ſo compoſed as they comprehend moſt certaine Truths, but appliable aſwell to the fifth Opinion (to be propounded yet) as to any other: But becauſe all men will fetch the interpretation of them from Doctor <hi>Whitakers</hi> the chiefe compoſer, his underſtanding of them muſt be taken for their meaning. And how hee underſtood the Doctrine of Predeſtination doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in his laſt <hi>Conc. ad clerum, Octob.</hi> 9. before this 20. of <hi>November,</hi> wherein hee argueth againſt St. <hi>Auſtine,</hi> That originall ſinne was not the cauſe of Reprobation, ſeeing it is remitted to many Reprobates, (according to St. <hi>Auguſtines</hi> Doctrine) <hi>pag.</hi> 7. He expoundeth <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 21. <hi>de maſſa incorrupta, pag.</hi> 8. and nameth <hi>Bucer</hi> as concurring with him, <hi>pag.</hi> 8. and <hi>iterum pag.</hi> 15. He appealeth to our Confeſſion in the 17. Article, which he is perſwaded delivers the ſame doctrine that hee did, not onely
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64487:12"/>
becauſe thoſe Articles were compoſed by the Diſciples of <hi>Martyr</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> as hee ſaith, but by the words themſelves. How other Biſhops and Profeſſors ſince have underſtood that Article, and what hand <hi>Martyr</hi> and <hi>Bucer</hi> had in our Articles, ſhall be ſeen in the next Opinion.</p>
                           <p>For, theſe nine Aſſertions, wee know, Doctor <hi>Whitakers</hi> dying at his return from his journey, were not received with ſuch accord, but that two the following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors diſſented from them, and when the life of Doctor <hi>Whitakers</hi> was written by a learned friend of his, who would have inſerted theſe nine Aſſertions, they were by authority ſuppreſſed; a ſigne that though much were imputed and yeelded to the excellent judgement of Doctor <hi>Whitakers</hi> of worthy memory, yet all in authority then were not of his minde in this matter; whom yet they would not offend or loſe, as the times then were. Neither in the firſt of King <hi>James</hi> in the Conference at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, when theſe nine Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, orthodoxall, as Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> termed them, were ſued for to be inſerted into the Booke of Articles, was this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt obtained; but that motion quenched by the ſpeeches, firſt, of the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> who had beene at the concluding

                        <p>This Opinion is miſliked by the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the former, and of the following Opinions alſo.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Becauſe to defend the juſtice of God, it ſuppoſeth mankinde corrupted before any Election or Reprobation was made, which ſeemeth needleſſe, becauſe there be Elect and Reprobate Angels, without or before any corruption or fall: <hi>Cacodaemones non fuere in Maſſâ, &amp; tamen Reprobati; Chriſtus non fuit in Maſſâ, and tamen ut homo Eligitur. Prideaux</hi> 1. <hi>Lectione.</hi>

is remitted in Baptiſme to many Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates. <hi>Whitaker. Cygnea Cant.</hi> p. 7.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Becauſe with the former Opinion it teacheth Chriſt to be ſent onely to the Elect, and the Word and Spirit onely to call them, whereby the Reprobate is but more oppreſſed, being call'd to embrace ſalvation offered, which they cannot doe, and yet for refuſall thereof they are more deeply condemned.</p>
                        <p>So theſe two Opinions offend much againſt Gods Goodneſſe and Truth: yet this ſecond well acknowledgeth, that God decreed ſomething upon his foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what man would doe being permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; That this foreknowledge is ſo certain, that upon it God builded his greateſt Counſels of the myſtery of the Goſpell, as upon the foreknowledge of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, the decree to ſend Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It provideth well for the juſtice of God on Infants dying, who have no other deſert of death but Originall ſin, from which as to the paine of eternall death, Gods mercy delivereth whom hee pleaſeth by Baptiſme, or the vow thereof in the holy Church; <hi>Parvuloru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> autem cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſam ad exemplum Majorum non patiuntur afferri;</hi> ſayes <hi>Hilary</hi> of the <hi>Maſſilienſes</hi> in which they were right: for the Election

or Reprobation which is of Infants that live not to years of diſcretion, is no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary pattern for the Election or Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of them that live into a further Age.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>That out of Gods fore knowledge of mans infirmity. and that none would believe by this common grace, he decreed to adde a ſpeciall grace more effectuall, and abundant, to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>This Opinion, if I underſtand it aright, I have not found expreſly or ſtrictly examined by any Divine: Doctor <hi>Abbot</hi> in his animadverſion upon <hi>Thompſons Diatribe</hi> ſuſpecteth <note n="*" place="margin">c. 4.

                        <p n="1">1. That common Grace by which no man is ſav'd, which is inferiour to the infirmity of man, is not the Grace of the Goſpell, nay deſerves not the name of Grace, which never brought forth the effect, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That ſuperabundant, ſpeciall, effectuall Grace, ſeemes not to be the Grace of the Goſpell, being rejected of none to whom it is offered: for the Grace of the Goſpell is ſuch as is receiv'd by ſome, and the ſelfe ſame rejected by other ſome; to ſome 'tis <hi>in vaine,</hi> to others, <hi>not in vaine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. This Opinion (with the two former) ſeemes to bring in a certaine deſperation into the mindes of men, (as was of old objected to St. <hi>Auguſtine)</hi> ſeeing none can be ſaved but by that ſpeciall and abundant
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64487:17"/>
Grace, which is given but to a few, out of the ſecret purpoſe of God; which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God doth intend to give or no, the generall promiſes in the Goſpell do not aſſure, ſeeing they ſound no more than a common grace, which is ineffectuall, by this Opinion.</p>

                              <p>Firſt, the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> make the generall and conditionall Decree of Predeſtination to be upon condition of believing accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to the generall Goſpell-promiſe of ſaving all men through Chriſt dying for them, if with a lively and perſevering faith they ſhall believe in him by the Word and holy Ghoſt aſſiſting it<hi>:</hi> Secondly, the ſpeciall and abſolute Decree to be out of the foreknowledge of Faith touching the ſaving all ſuch particular men, whom God foreſaw would believe through grace, and on the other ſide condemning of thoſe whom hee foreſaw would continue impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent in ſinne, and unbelievers.

Thirdly, our Church taking the middle way, joynes the particular abſolute Decree (not out of foreknowledge of mans Faith, or Free-wil, but out of the purpoſe of Gods Will and Grace) touching the freeing and ſaving thoſe whom God hath elected in Chriſt, with the generall and conditionall Will, or the generall promiſe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell; Teaching Gods Promiſes are ſo to be embraced as they are propoſed to us in the holy Scriptures, and that Will of God is to be followed of us, which wee have expreſly revealed in his Word; as namely, that <hi>God gave his Sonne for the World,</hi> or for all mankinde; That <hi>Chriſt offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a Sacrifice for all the ſinnes of the whole World;</hi> That <hi>Chriſt redeemed all mankinde;</hi> That <hi>Christ commanded the Gospell to be preached unto all; that God Wils and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands all men to heare Chriſt, and to believe in him; and in him to offer grace and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto all men.</hi> That this is the infallible truth, in which there can be no falſhood, otherwiſe the Apoſtles and other Miniſters of the Goſpell, preaching the ſame, ſhould bee falſe witneſſes of God, and ſhould make him a Lyar; And this Opinion agrees with the judgement of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> as he is expounded by <hi>Prosper</hi> and <hi>Fulgentius;</hi> It is the more common Doctrine of the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64487:18"/>
Church after St. <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> And theſe two things do well ſtand together; God in the firſt place, to offer ſalvation to all, if they will believe, and common grace and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in the means ordain'd by God, if men will not be wanting to the Word of God and his holy Spirit. And then in the ſecond place God that he might be helpfull to humane frailty, and mans ſalvation might bee more certaine, would adde his ſpeciall, more effectuall and abundant grace to be communicated to whom hee pleaſe, by which not onely they are able to beleeve, or obey, if they pleaſe, but alſo actually do will, believe, obey and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, according to the ſentence of St. <hi>Auguſtine, Sic Deus ordinavit omnium Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loru hominumque vitam, &amp;c. So God ordain'd the life of all Angells and Men, that therein hee might firſt manifeſt how farre Freewill could goe; and then what the benefit of his grace, and the judgement of righteouſnes could doe.

                              <p>In like manner of the Death of Chriſt for all, there are three Opinions.</p>
                              <p>The firſt, that Chriſt dyed for all men, and by his Death did redeeme all mankind

in Gods generall and conditionall purpoſe of giving ſalvation for Chriſts ſake that dyed, to all upon condition of Faith de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the free cooperation of men under Grace.</p>
                              <p>The Second contrary to the firſt, that Chriſt did not dye for all, &amp;c. nor did redeeme all mankinde, &amp;c. nor that God by any manner of meanes, or upon any condition, did will, or intend to give ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Grace for Chriſts ſake to any other ſave only the Elect, &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>The Third, ſuppoſing Chriſts Death for all men, and Gods purpoſe conditioned with the generall grace of the Goſpell-promiſes, addes the ſpeciall intention of Faith, touching the applying the benefit of Chriſts death, by grace more abounding, and effectuall, abſolutely, certainly and infallibly onely to the Elect, without any prejudice, or any diminution of the Will and Grace common and ſufficient.</p>

                              <p>All agree that Freewill is not able to do any thing that is good, without Grace preventing, preſent and ſubſequent, ſo as it holds the beginning, middle and end in converſion, and Faith, and every good

                              <p>The firſt Opinion makes Grace ſo to worke in man, that it takes not away the liberty of his Will, but preſerves it; ſo that a man may by Grace ſo beleeve and obey, as that hee may alſo by his Freewill reſiſt Grace.

The third Opinion teacheth, men may be ſo ſtirr'd up and mov'd by Grace, that they may both obey that Grace calling and moving, if they attend thereto, and alſo may through their Freewils reſiſt Gods Call and Motion: but it addes further, that God, when hee will, and to whom hee will, doth give Grace ſo abundant, or powerfull, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruent, or ſome other way effectuall, ſo that although the Will in reſpect of its li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty may reſiſt, yet it doth not reſiſt, but certainly and infallibly obey: and thus God to deale with thoſe whom hee hath elected in Chriſt, ſo far forth as is neceſſary to their ſalvation.</p>

                              <p>The firſt Opinion makes all Believers to bee ſo furniſh'd with Gods Grace, that they are able to perſevere, if they will be as carefull as they ſhould be; that the ſame men alſo may poſſibly fall away from Faith and Grace, through negligence and ſecurity.</p>
                              <p>The Second denyes Believers to be able ſo to fall away from Faith and Gods Grace, as to become in the ſtate of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:64487:20"/>
or periſh; but ſuch as ſhall once truely believe, ſhall alwayes ſo perſevere in Faith and Grace, that at length they may all attaine ſalvation.</p>
                              <p>The Third, with St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> makes Believers, through the infirmities of the fleſh, and temptations, to be able to depart from Faith and Grace, or likewiſe to fall away; but it addes, thoſe Believers who are call'd according to purpoſe, and who are firmly rooted in a lively Faith, cannot ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther totally or finally fall away, or periſh, but by ſpeciall and effectuall grace, ſo to perſevere in a true and lively Faith, that at length they may bee brought to eternall life.</p>
                              <p>By this we may underſtand what Doctor <hi>Overalds</hi> minde was in the Conference at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, <hi>p.</hi> 41. 42. <hi>Richard Thompſon</hi> hath the like <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>De interciſione Juſtitiae.</hi> For after hee had ſpoken of Chriſt, given to redeeme and reconcile all unto God; and of aides and meanes given where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men may be actually reconciled, hee addes <hi>page</hi> 17. <hi>Sed miſerum genus huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſi vel ſic à Deo relictum fuiſſet, &amp;c.</hi> But miſerable had been Mankinde, if even ſo they had been left of God; for great is the wickedneſſe of Man, and every imagination of his heart is evil continually.

Therefore it muſt needs come to paſſe, that either all of themſelves ſhould deſpiſe thoſe riches of Gods goodneſſe, or if any ſhould make uſe of them, yet a while after they would loath them againe, except the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abundant mercy of God had ſeparated ſome to himſelfe, to whom hee had decreed from all eternity, to afford an effectuall calling, and finall perſeverance in Grace taken according to his purpoſe; others being paſſed by, and left to the counſels of common providence, whom in the end he would condemn for their impenitence and unbeliefe.</p>

                        <p>Yet this Opinion doth well to enlarge the objects of Gods foreknowledge, and to extend it, not onely to the fall of the firſt man, but even to Chriſt to be manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fleſh, and believed on in the World, yea even to the laſt end of all men, perſevering either in Faith or Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe.

A knowledge confeſſed and ſuppoſed by the defenders of the ſecond third and fourth Opinions, who teach that by his knowledge God did foreknow the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> before he decreed to create him, and before he decreed to ſend his Son to redeeme him; for with them, and with truth, God did not firſt decree to create man, and to permit him to fall, and then was to ſeeke a remedy how to relieve him, but foreknew the remedy that he could uſe if he ſhould fall, before he decreed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to fall, or to create him; yea ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly did God foreknow the ſinfull fall of man, (which yet was not Gods Act, but mans, and a contingent Act of a free crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) that upon this foreknowledge he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived the whole myſtery of Chriſt, and of our Redemption.</p>

Now if this knowledge were uſed in one contingent thing, it might have been uſed in a Million; if in one free Act of the firſt man, then in all the free Acts of all men; and if in that which was the occaſion of Gods mercy in our Redemption, then in all occaſions of Gods Acts, that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent Acts, even of the Generall Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſhall be at the laſt day: For Gods knowledge is infinite.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. This knowledge of God, being previall to his predeſtinating, did not look therefore to the Maſſe of mankind as created and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupted, nor to the Maſſe fallen and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, nor to Chriſt beleeved on only, but to theſe, and beyond all theſe, to the firſt, middle and finall ſtate of every particular man, and the Univerſall ſtate of all men.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. This will of God is abſolute, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, having no other cauſe but his owne good pleaſure: for, when as, untill God make his decrees, all things are knowne but as poſſible, and are yet under the pleaſure of God, whether they ſhall be or no, how can they poſſibly be the Cauſes of his will? He underſtandeth them indeed, as he hath contrived them, fit to be willed, becauſe they are fit to ſhew forth all his glory, and therefore in the end he willeth them: but he could contrive other things than theſe, or ſet theſe ſome other way as fit to ſhew forth his glory, if he would; Therefore that he willeth theſe, it is his own moſt free pleaſure. <hi>Hinc autem nullam eſſe Praedeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationis cauſam in praedeſtinato patet, quia cum homo praedeſtinandus nullo modo cenſeatur propriè exiſtere, ſed conditionaliter tantum,</hi>

                        <p>Yet if their deſire be to have it onely admitted and granted, (which was <hi>Origens</hi> minde,) that there goes with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God, a good liking and a well-pleaſing, and approving of the ſubject foreknowne, as fit to be loved, and capable of chooſing, I ſhall not onely allow but maintaine their deſire: for this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why in Scripture (not in Schooles) the good and the Elect are called onely <hi>Praeſciti,</hi> or foreknowne, and not the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate; (though ſimply they alſo were foreknowne, as God being not ignorant of them) but there was not that in them,

which hee might approve or thinke well of: yet this doth neither hinder the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of foreknowledge properly as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in the Underſtanding, nor infer an argument that the Perſons choſen, were choſen for the good that was approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them; or that they could not but be choſen, becauſe they were good in Gods knowledge: for many worlds of men God might ſee in that infinite knowledge which now I ſpeake of, as eligible as theſe whom hee hath choſen; all which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding hee hath covered in the eternall darkneſſe of never-being: for to bee eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, and to be Elect, I trow, are two things, that need not ever follow one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>

This firſt Will of God never faileth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee workes it himſelfe alone by his Almighty power. 2.

From <hi>Adam</hi> to the Confuſion of tongues, while the whole Earth was of one lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage, it doth not appeare but the Calling was Univerſall, all men being within the hearing of the Preachers of Righteouſneſſe: After the diviſion of Tongues, men forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the religious Fathers, God permitted them to walk in their owne wayes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed his Calling and Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147. 19. and ſo narrowed the bounds of his Church, that is, of the <hi>Called.</hi>

That one while the <hi>Gentiles</hi> ſhould bee ſhut out, and the <hi>Jewes</hi> admitted; and another while the <hi>Gentiles</hi> admitted and the <hi>Jewes</hi> excluded from the Mercy of Gods gracious Calling: of which St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 9. 10. 11.</p>
                           <p>Now in the diviſion and diſperſion of Nations, why God did leave the reſt, and called out <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeede to make Covenant with, no reaſon can be given of merit, or demerit, more in one than in the other, but it muſt be aſcribed to the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and pleaſure of God alone, as it is by <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 7. 8. &amp; 10. 15. by <hi>Joſua</hi> cap. 24. 2, 3. by <hi>Nehem.</hi> cap. 9. 7. by S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 9. 11. <hi>Not of workes but of him that Calleth.</hi>

                        <div type="section">

                           <head>This Doctrine is to bee examined.</head>
                           <p>I diſtinguiſh not two Callings, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound one Calling of the Word and Spirit, as it were of a Body and a Soule, ſuppoſing it to have in it ſelfe power to bring forth Effect in all that are under it; and if it doe not ſo, the cauſe not to ariſe from the Calling, but from the Called that obey not.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. For declaration of this Point, it muſt not be thought, that the Spirit goeth with the Word, to make the hearer performe that which he can doe by naturall ſtrength (for the Spirit is given to helpe where nature faileth) as to keepe waking, and to be attentive; for that which Men can bring of their owne ſtrength, God expecteth to finde and to meete. One caſe then where to many the Spirit is not preſent to the Word, is, when they are not preſent to the very Word, through their ſottiſh care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Againe, it muſt not be thought that the concurrence of the Word and Spirit is as it were naturall, neceſſary and inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, but voluntary and arbitrary, in the Will and good Pleaſure of God; and as grace is annexed to the Sacraments, ſo is it to the Word, onely by Divine Inſtitution
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64487:54"/>
and Ordination. Hence the Church pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth before Sermons, for the illumination and power of the Spirit to come with the Word; God expecting to have this asked of him by them that can pray, both for themſelves and others: Another caſe then where the Spirit is not co-working with the word many times, is, when it was not duly and diligently asked.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. There are men that are paſt grace, to whom the Spirit is not preſent with the Word, ſuch as for their former neglect and contempt of the time of their viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when God did call them, are now given up to blindneſſe and hardneſſe; and have the light of the Spirit, and the dew of grace held back from that Word which is Preached in their hearing by accident, not for their ſakes (though we know them not in particular, and ſo admit all.)</p>
                           <p n="4">4. It muſt not bee thought, that the Spirit goes with the Word, to worke any grace in any perſon whatſoever, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the order of Divine Providence, which diſpenſeth his grace wiſely: which is thus to be declar'd.</p>
                           <p>Wee are to diſtinguiſh the <hi>Word</hi> that calleth; the <hi>Perſons</hi> that are called; and <hi>operations</hi> of the Spirit by the Word in thoſe perſons.</p>

                           <p n="4">4. To give them repentance: that is, to ſorrow for ſin paſt with a godly ſorrow, and to purpoſe to break off ſin, &amp; to ceaſe from any further offending God, or endangering the Soule.</p>

                           <p>Theſe Graces in this Order the holy Ghoſt is preſent and ready to worke by the Goſpell upon a ſinner convict, humbled and prepared by the Law. And looke what proportion of power the Spirit had in the Law, upon an unregenerate Man to humble him; the ſame hath it in the Goſpell, upon the humbled, to worke in him Hope; him Hoping, to winne to Wiſh and Pray; to him Praying, Wiſhing, Willing, to give Repentance; unto him Repenting, to inſtill Faith, and ſo to juſtifie him; being juſtifyed by Faith, again by the Law and the Goſpell together, to mortifie corruptions, to quicken in him a new life, and to ſtrengthen him to new obedience.</p>
                           <p>Now thinke not that the Spirit is preſent in the preaching of the Law to an unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Man, to give him ſtrength to new obedience, becauſe it is preſent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and condemne his wickedneſſe; or becauſe it is ſo preſent to a juſtifyed Man to give him ſtrength to new obedience; Thinke not that the Spirit is preſent in the preaching of the Goſpell to a Man yet not penitent, nor believing, to worke in
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:64487:57"/>
him Peace, Joy, Love, becauſe it is preſent to worke theſe in the Believer: Degrees here are not given <hi>per ſaltum.</hi> The ſum is, The Spirit of God is annexed to his Word for ſuch gifts and operations as to which the hearer is a fit diſpoſed ſubject: There is an order in the Divine working, wherein there are things antecedent, preparatives to things ſubſequent, which antecedents if they found no place, and were not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the ſubſequent are ſuſpended: Hence is there ſo frequent and juſt ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit from the Word by the great Paſtor of Soules, who walketh in the midſt of the Churches, and ſcarcheth the hearts and reynes.</p>

                           <p>To conclude; That Diſtinction of <hi>Calling</hi> propounded in the beginning of this <hi>Chapter</hi> into <hi>Outward Inward Effectuall Ineffectual,</hi> ſeemeth to be vaine.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Becauſe it giveth unworthily the name of <hi>Calling</hi> to the bare outward Preaching of the Word, which may bee a <hi>Commanding,</hi> but not a <hi>Calling;</hi> a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding</hi> as of the Law, not a <hi>Calling</hi> as of the Goſpell: (for God may ſtill require to be obeyed in whatſoever new thing hee ſhall command, becauſe it is our duty na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, whether wee be now able to doe it or no<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being, wee were able.) But ſeeing the word of the new Covenant comes to <hi>call</hi> Men to Repentance and Faith, for their recovery after notice taken of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency to riſe again of themſelves, it ſeems an inſulting mock, and not a <hi>Call,</hi> to ſay to ſinners, <hi>Turne, repent, believe and live;</hi> unleſſe there be ſome grace prepared for them, whereby they may be able to repent and believe.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Becauſe it attributeth the Effect of obeying the <hi>Calling</hi> to the kinde of <hi>Calling</hi> it ſelfe, and onely to one cauſe, the <hi>operation of the Spirit:</hi> as if many cauſes did not concur to produce an Effect, and if any
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64487:59"/>
one faile the Effect faileth: As if obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the <hi>Calling</hi> of God were not an Act of the will of Man, (under the ayde of the Spirit of God;) as if the ayde of the Spirit were never refuſed, nor the Grace of God never received in vaine: For though God be almighty and able to draw all ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes unto his part and ſide, yet he doth not uſe to diſturbe or croſſe the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Cauſes, nor the order of things which himſelfe hath eſtabliſhed.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. Becauſe it maketh Gods Covenant to differ from all Covenants in humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, even in that which is eſſentiall to a Covenant, (yet this terme and title is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from men, the better to conceive of the Grace of God, &amp; the duty of man.) In our Covenants each party hath ſomething to performe, and no one party doth all in a Covenant: but by this diſtinction God is ſuppoſed both to provide infallibly to have the conditions fulfilled, and alſo to fulfill his owne promiſes, whereas all that he undertaketh for us, is to make the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions poſſible, and not to be wanting in his helpe, ſo far as is needfull for us; <hi>Eſay</hi> 59. <hi>ult.</hi> And check me not that I am afraid to give too much to God, leſt I check you againe that you looke to be ſo much favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as to be tyed to nothing.</p>

The <hi>Converſion</hi> of a ſinner is alſo to be conſidered as <hi>Prima,</hi> or <hi>Poſterior.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The firſt is, when a man of a naturall man is made a regenerate man, and a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Gods Church, as the Gentiles called by the Apoſtles, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. 3. Such were we all that are converted unto God, having been firſt averted, <hi>fooliſh, diſobedient, decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, ſerving divers luſts,</hi> Tit. 3. 3.</p>
                        <p>The latter <hi>Converſion</hi> is, when a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man having committed iniquity, and fallen into ſin, returneth unto God by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance of that ſinne<hi>:</hi> Thus <hi>Peter</hi> that was foretold of denying Chriſt, and that yet his faith ſhould not <hi>finally faile,</hi> was willed, that he <hi>being converted ſhould ſtrengthen his Brethren, Luk.</hi> 22. 32. See <hi>Bilſon</hi> of ſupremacy <hi>pag.</hi> 278. 279. in 4.</p>
                        <p>Next the Cauſes of our <hi>Converſion</hi> are to be conſidered; without queſtion <hi>Gods holy ſpirit</hi> working upon the heart of a ſinner, is the prime, principall, efficient, powerfull Cauſe of his Converſion; <hi>Turne us and we ſhall be turned, Lam.</hi> 5. 21. in the beginning, in the middle, and in the end of it.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>word preached</hi> is the ordinary, Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Cauſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7. Adjuvant Cauſes, are the <hi>Croſſe</hi> that chaſtneth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. 18.

                           <hi>Bleſſings</hi> that draw and allure the <hi>prayers</hi> of others; the <hi>holy example</hi> of others alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy converted, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>But it is in queſtion, what part the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner himſelfe, who is the ſubject to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, beareth in his owne Converſion, being a living and reaſonable Subject<hi>:</hi> Whether he be active or paſſive in it; when and how far; whether he can further it, or hinder it; or whether it be poſſible for two ſuppoſed equally called, one to be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and not the other? If ſo, then whence this difference ſhall ariſe, whether from God, or from Man?</p>
                        <p>The determination of theſe queſtions cannot be cleare, nor the manner of our converſion opened, untill we have declared what is to be holden according to the Scriptures, touching Gods free Grace, and Mans freewill, which we will indeavour to bring into more manifeſt light, after ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement Conflicts of the learned in all Ages, which have raiſed clouds of obſcurity to the loſſe of Truth amongſt the ſtrivers for it.</p>

                        <p>OF <hi>Grace</hi> and Freewill I will ſpeak by Gods grace, firſt ſeverally, then joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: that ſo we may returne to the point of our Converſion, to behold what be the parts of God therein, and what of Man.</p>
                        <p>Of <hi>Grace</hi> I ſhall endeavour to declare the Thing, the Diſtinctions, the Neceſſity, the Amplitude, the Power and force there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
                        <p>By <hi>Grace</hi> may be underſtood all that proceedeth from God out of free favour to an unworthy ſinner, tending to his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: yet here by <hi>Grace</hi> I will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the remaines of Nature, as ſome light of Reaſon, ſome ſenſe of Conſcience, and the like; though it was of <hi>Grace</hi> that theſe were ſpared and left to remaine in Man fallen.</p>
                        <p>Neither will I by <hi>Grace</hi> underſtand the Law, deſcribing the righteouſneſſe of works, though the preacher of Grace doth uſe the Law to ſhew a ſinner his Eſtate, and to prepare him to Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>Nor will I underſtand the bare outward

word of the Goſpel, though it be called <hi>Verbum gratiae,</hi> Act. 20. 32. if not rather it be ſo called, becauſe the internall Grace of God goeth with it.</p>
                        <p>But by <hi>Grace</hi> I underſtand the internall Illuminations, Teachings, Motions, Tracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Inſpirations, Operations, Gifts of the holy Ghoſt, merited by Chriſt to be given to the ſinfull Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> in their fit time and order, to the end to raiſe them fallen, and to ſave them loſt; whence I ſhall call it with Saint <hi>Auguſt. Gratiam Chriſti;</hi> There is in man no merit of <hi>Grace,</hi> for then grace were no grace, there is only an occaſion, namely, the wofull miſery of Man, which yet was in Gods pleaſure to take as an occaſion, or to refuſe it.</p>
                        <p>Even the good uſe of former <hi>Graces</hi> is no merit or cauſe of the giving of fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Graces;</hi> but the ſecond are as free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given as the firſt; for Gods good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure alone is the Author and Cauſe of that order and ſucceſſion that is in graces, in which he hath appointed to doe one thing in order after another, and not one thing for the ſake of another.</p>

It is good for me to stick cloſe to God: for neither is the Creature any ſuch thing, as that without his Maker, he ſhould be able of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to doe any good thing: But his chiefe good worke is, to be converted to his Maker, and by him continually to be made Juſt, Godly, Wiſe and Bleſſed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>As the Ayre, light being preſent, is not made a lucid Body</hi> (like the Sun, which gives light) <hi>but onely becomes light, becauſe if it were made ſuch, it could not poſſibly be but that even in the abſence of light, it ſhould continue lucid: Even ſo man, God being preſent with him, is illightned, but being abſent, is immediatly darkned, from whom we depart, not ſo much in diſtance of place, as in forſaking him wilfully.</hi>

                           <p>This is that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. exhorting them that <hi>received and obeyed the Goſpel, to worke out their Salvation;</hi> having received the power to worke; yet becauſe they might feare their owne weakneſſe and infirmity even in u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the power in this working out their own Salvation, he doth Comfort and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them, that they ſhall not work alone, a ſtronger than they ſhall joyne with them, God, who it is that ever worketh in them both <hi>to will and to doe.</hi> Where we have full proofe for the power and preſence of the <hi>helpfull grace</hi> of God; but for <hi>Gratia diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminatrix</hi>

                              <hi>Lord, we beſeech thee to keepe thy Church and houſhold continually in the true religion, that they which doe leane onely upon hope of thy heavenly grace, may evermore be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by thy mighty power, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Againſt whom then do theſe accuſations lye? To ſay, that the Will of man reſiſts the power of God, as if it were ſtronger than it.</p>
                           <p>That man doth more to the work of his Faith, than the Grace of God.</p>
                           <p>That God doth no more in us for good, than Satan doth for evill, incline, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade, ſollicite, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I am no way guilty of theſe crimes: If Gods power be reſiſted or fruſtrated, it yeeldeth not out of weakneſſe but out of will, God not pleaſing to put forth his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, where he feeles himſelfe reſiſted or neglected. The beſt that we doe in the bringing forth of any good is, To yeild, and to permit God to work upon us, to follow him leading or drawing of us, to accept of that he giveth us, to fence that which he ſoweth or planteth in us, not to marre that which he maketh, not to harden the heart when his voice is to be heard: In
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64487:66"/>
ſumme, to be paſſively obedient, more than actively.</p>
                           <p>For this is that onely which the <hi>Power of Grace</hi> will not extend it ſelfe unto, To neceſſitate, and to hold us up to an unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable obedience; The reaſon is, becauſe that power of God which buildeth up ſupernaturall things, doth not deſtroy naturall: but the poſſiblity in the Will to decline to evill, and the liberty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey, is not evill, but naturall, being found in <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, and as it was not impeached then by the ſupernaturall grace which <hi>Adam</hi> had, no more is it now in us. by the grace of God that worketh in us</p>

That with the promiſe and word of the Goſpel there goeth ordinarily ſuch <hi>Grace</hi> of the holy Spirit, as is ſufficient to all under the Goſpel, to worke in them to believe and to obey the Goſpell; and that all doe not obey, proceedeth not from the want of <hi>Grace</hi> on Gods part, but from mens being wanting to the <hi>Grace</hi> of God, to whom it is in vaine, as is evident by 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 1. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 1. 2. 12. 15.</p>

two muſt be ſo conſtrued that they may both ſtand together; Thus, that out of Gods goodneſſe, mercy, and love to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, hee ſent his Sonne to die for all men, as willing by his primary and ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent will the ſalvation of all men. But becauſe Omniſcience is in God as one of his Divine perfections, hee could not bee ignorant or incertaine, what would be the fruit and ſucceſſe of the Death of his Son; that ſuch would not receive him, that others ſuch and ſuch would thankefully embrace him, if hee were ſent unto them; out of this foreknowledge his eſpeciall love accepting even theſe, though few in number in compariſon, did ſend his Sonne with intention to ſave, though it were but theſe, in whom hee would glorifie his bounty, that for their ſakes hee would have his Sonne to give his life, though hee ſhould gaine no more than them, who had they beene much fewer, or none at all, ſurely the wiſe God either would not have ſent his Sonne to die in vaine, or he would have mended the meaſure and courſe of his graces and government, by which more might have come into the Kingdome of Heaven.</p>

                              <hi>Freewill to Good</hi> was put into the firſt Man by God at his Creation, a faculty of his reaſonable ſoule created good; It was corroborated and guarded then by an aſſiſtance of ſupernaturall grace given by God to make him will good, more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, conſtantly, and the higheſt eminent kinde of good. But by the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> this ſupernaturall grace fortifying the will to good, was utterly loſt; and Secondly, the very freedome to any good of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour kinde; 1. Spirituall, as to love God above all, to worke the righteouſnes of the Law as the Law is ſpirituall, to doe any act ſutable or equall to theſe, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, to believe in Chriſt: This freedome to good is wholy loſt.</p>
                           <p>Some freedome to humane, naturall, civill and morall good acts is onely remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and freedome to the outward good acts of Religion, as to goe to a Church, to
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:64487:70"/>
heare, to attend, to conſider, and compare the things delivered by the Preacher of Gods Word, as a man can doe the rules or definition of any act or Science in the Schooles: If then wee ſeeke for a <hi>freedome of will</hi> to ſpirituall and ſupernaturall good in the nature of man now fallen, wee ſhall not finde it there, unleſſe we find it reſtored and renewed by the grace of Chriſt that goes with the Goſpell. If the Sonne makes us free wee ſhall be free indeed. Without <hi>Grace, Freewill to Good</hi> is not once to bee imagined in fallen man.</p>
                           <p>I muſt declare this by diſtinguiſhing the ſpirituall good to which freedome is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored by grace; There is the ſpiritual good commanded by the Law, as Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and true Holineſſe. To this good <hi>Freewill</hi> is loſt, and is not reſtored by grace at firſt, and immediately, but late, after a man is juſtified, and made a new creature by grace.</p>
                           <p>There is another kinde of ſpirituall good, not ſimply good, but in a caſe when ſinne is once committed, (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith of <hi>Verecundia,</hi> that it is good <hi>Ex hypotheſi</hi> of a fault) that is, Compunction, Feare, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience accuſing, ſenſe of guiltineſſe. The <hi>freedome of will</hi> to this good remaines commonly in a ſinner after his fall, nay
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:64487:70"/>
ſometime hee is ſmitten with terror, will hee, nill hee; As <hi>Adam</hi> when hee had ſinned, feared and fled, and hid his head. But if by cuſtome in ſinne this alſo be loſt, the Spirit of God in the Law ſetteth upon the will to free it from the bondage of this ſecurity, and under the Law the will is free to feare.</p>
                           <p>There is a third kinde of ſpirituall good commanded by the Goſpell, To repent and to believe in Chriſt; To theſe the will of Man is not <hi>free</hi> of it ſelfe, but the ſame Goſpell that commands them, brings to the will a <hi>freedome</hi> to them, which may be conceived poſſible to be done by two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of wayes.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. By framing the Commandments of the Goſpell ſo eaſy and accomodate to the weakneſſe and miſery of the Will of man, that there may be a proportion betweene the will of a ſinner, and the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Goſpell; and then the grace of the Goſpell ſhall lie in this deſcending to the imbecility of the will, and in accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating the worke to the workeman, the task to the labourer.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Or by bringing and giving to the will ſo much power and helpe, as is requiſite to make a ſinner able to doe the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Goſpell; admitting the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:64487:71"/>
Commandements to lay on him a worke as hard and as heavy, as the workes of the Law.</p>
                           <p>I will not bee ſo ſtiffe to maintaine the firſt way, as the ſecond, although to repent of ſinne, to believe in the Mercy of God, to reſt in the Merits of the Sonne of God, ſeeme to be acts and duties very mercifully prepared by God, as tendring the weakneſs and miſery of a ſinner, and fitted to his Eſtate.</p>
                           <p>But I maintaine that the grace which reſtores <hi>freedome to the will,</hi> to will the good of the Goſpell, comes with the Goſpell, which preventeth mans will, and prepares it by infuſing into it the power to will the ſpirituall good things required by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, in that order and proceſſe which was declared before in the Doctrine of Calling.</p>
                           <p>Depreſſe the nature of man as much as you will, call his <hi>Arbitrium, ſervum ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrium,</hi> the more I predicate the grace of God, which is proportion'd and fitted in goodneſſe and power to quicken the dead, to ſtrengthen the impotent, to looſen the captive and moſt miſerable <hi>will</hi> of Man. This being the very grace of the Goſpell, that it makes the Commandements of it poſſible to be obeyed by man fallen, which
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64487:71"/>
the Law doth not, ſo that no Man under the Goſpell can be excuſed in his diſobey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpell from his want of power, or impotency to repent or believe.</p>
                           <p>And this was one reaſon of my Title choſen with reſpect to this part of my Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, <hi>Appello Evangelium: Freedome</hi> on the left ſide of the will, as I may call it, is to will Evill; that is, under the grace of God, or notwithſtanding the grace of God, whereby I may will good, yet I may decline to evill, and leave the good.</p>
                           <p>This was in <hi>Adam</hi> before his Fall, a ſingle, innocent poſſibility to decline to evill, the very mutability of the Creature, ſeeing it is proper to God to be immutably good: So that the very ſupernaturall grace that <hi>Adam</hi> had for his corroboration to God, yet did not immobilitate his will to evill.</p>
                           <p>This is the root of the praiſe of humane righteouſneſſe, for hee is to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that could tranſgreſſe and would not, not hee that was good and could bee no other. (The example of the righteous God is not here to be objected, ſince he is above and out of all predicaments, wherein wee are.) This is called <hi>Reſiſtentia connata,</hi> which Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> confeſſeth is not taken away by grace.</p>

                              <pb n="234" facs="tcp:64487:72"/>

                           <p>Theſe two muſt carefully be ſever'd, for when I uſe theſe termes, the freedome to ſinne, preſently ſome body takes me down that the <hi>freedome</hi> to ſinne is a ſervitude, the <hi>bondage</hi> and miſery of the Will, not obſerving that the <hi>freedome</hi> to ſinne is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and before the fall; the <hi>bondage</hi> to ſinne ſince the fall, and of corrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and theſe two differ aſmuch as a live mortall man, and a dead man.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>freedome to evill</hi> is not evill, but the uſe and practiſe of that <hi>freedom is evill:</hi> The proneneſſe to evill which is now in us, is evill.</p>

                        <p>TO declare how theſe two are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynd in every ſpirituall worke, let me firſt poſſeſſe you with three Principles or Axiomes:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That in all the operations of theſe two (if wee ſuppoſe them Co-workers) either in our firſt converſion, or in every good worke, Grace is evermore foremoſt, the beginner, leader, principall in all; not onely in the firſt, but alſo in the ſecond, third, and fourth operations to the laſt<hi>:</hi> The will of man never working alone, never working foremoſt; but as the wheele of the Water-mill, is ſet a going and kept a going by the continuall following of the water, which being ſtayd the wheele ſoone ſtayeth; So mans will is ſet a going, and kept on going, by the perpetuall ſtreame of Gods grace, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 13. and this ariſeth <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, out of Gods good will, and deſire of our ſalvation.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Veteres dixerunt precedente gratiâ comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tante voluntate bona opera fieri; Melancto. loc. com. de lib. arbitr.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. That when Grace worketh upon mans underſtanding, will or affections, it
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64487:73"/>
worketh ſo as it preſerveth and uſeth the naturall Properties, Powers and Motions of a reaſonable Creature compounded as man is: <hi>Gratia non tollit naturam, ſed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficit, nec natura gratiam repellit, ſed ſuſcipit.</hi> Hence it is that though the habits of Faith, Hope and Charity, and the like, are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite by mans induſtry alone, but infuſed by God; yet they are infuſed after the manner of acquiſites, God having ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to infuſe them, but upon the means of Hearing, Praying, Caring, Studying, and endeavouring.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Non ego, ſed gratia Dei mecum; id eſt, non ſolus, ſed gratia Dei mecum, ac per hoc nec gratia Dei ſola, nec ipſe ſolus, ſed gratia Dei cum illo.</hi> Aug. de grat. &amp; lib. arbitr. Cap. 5.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That in all the operations of Grace, the nature and will of man being prevented by grace, is to depend upon God as the Creature upon the Creator, the receiver upon the giver, the weak upon the ſtrong, the imperfect upon the perficient, and the ſupplyant on his Lord; as the Earth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the Heavens for ſhowers, for heat and influence: which when man neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecteth, forgetteth or refuſeth to doe, he is dry, barren and unfruitfull in all ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all fruit.</p>

Opus imperfectum in <hi>Mat. Homil.</hi> 14. ex cap. 6. in illa, Fiat voluntas tua, &amp;c. Vide quam caute loquutus eſt, &amp;c. <hi>Behold how cautelouſly he speaketh: He ſaith not, Father, ſanctifie thy Name in us, bring thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome upon us, make thy will to bee done of us; leſt God ſhould ſeeme to ſanctifie himſelf upon men, or to bring his Kingdome upon whom hee liſt, or to make his will be done by whom he pleaſe, and in regard thereof God ſhould be perceived to be a Respecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Againe, neither hath hee ſaid, Let us ſanctifie thy Name, let us take thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, let us doe thy Will in Earth as it is in Heaven; lest it ſhould ſeeme that it proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from men alone, that they ſanctifyed Gods Name, or that they receiv'd his Kingdome, or that they did his Will: But hee ſpeakes in a middle way and imperſonally; Hallowed be thy Name; Thy Kingdome come; Thy will be done, that he may manifeſt how need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full the worke of both parties is, becauſe both man hath neede of God, and God is helpfull to man, for the performing of Righteouſnes. For as Man can doe no good, except he have Gods helpe, ſo neither doth God worke any good in man, except man be willing: As neither the earth without ſeed fructifies, nor ſeed without the Earth: ſo neither man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, nor God without man doth worke righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p>Now to try out the Truth, let mee ſet forth into view foure Propoſitions:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. <hi>Without the Grace of God the will of Man can, and doth both will and perform that which is good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Without the Grace of God the will of Man cannot will good, but through Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once made able to will, afterward, without any further Grace, it can alone both will and performe that which is good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="3">3. <hi>By or through the Grace of God working on the will, the will of Man can both will and performe that which is good, and without grace it cannot will, nor without further grace performe that which is good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="4">4. <hi>By or through the Grace of God working on the will, the will of man cannot but will, cannot but performe that which is good.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The firſt Propoſition of theſe, is the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie of <hi>Pelagius</hi> deteſted by the whole Church of Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>The Second Propoſition is the error of the <hi>Maſſilienſes</hi> or <hi>Semipelagians.</hi> And both theſe are againſt my firſt Principle or <hi>Maxime.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Third Propoſition holdeth out the light of Truth, ſubjoyning the will of man
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64487:74"/>
to the Grace of God both in willing and performing that which is good, and is the Doctrine of S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> in his ſetled judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Catholick Doctrine of the Church.</p>
                        <p>The Fourth Propoſition is the extreme opinion of S. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> in his heat of diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation againſt <hi>Pelagius</hi> and the <hi>Maſſilien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> and of many moderne Divines, of force defended to ſupport your Doctrine of the Order of Predeſtination, without the preſcience of all particular events (put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting onely the preſcience of <hi>Adams</hi> fall.) But this fourth Propoſition is deſtroyed by my two latter Principles or Axioms, or they deſtroy'd by it. Well ſaid <hi>Nazianz.</hi> in the caſe of extreme Opinions about the Trinity.</p>
                        <p>Quid enim neceſſe eſt tanquam ramum omnino in aliam partem declinantem, <hi>&amp;c. For what neceſſity is there, as a bough decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning altogether one way, by force to bend it the other way, and ſo by crookedneſſe to rectifie crookedneſſe; and not rather to keep to the middle way, and continue within the bounds of divine Piety? but when I name the middle way, I meane the Truth, to which onely we ſo rightly direct our ſelves.</hi> Orat. 17.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Saint</hi> Auguſtine <hi>maintained, through Grace ſuch help was afforded to the predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,</hi>
                           <pb n="240" facs="tcp:64487:75"/>
                           <hi>that not onely they were not able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere without that gift, but alſo through meanes of that gift could not chuſe but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere: whereupon Saint</hi> Hilary <hi>writes to Saint</hi> Auguſtine, His verbis Sanctitatis tuae ita moventur, ut dicant quandam deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem hominibus exhiberi<hi>: That by ſuch Speeches of his Sonne men were moved to ſay, They held forth a kinde of Deſperation unto men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>It were a labour worth the taking to compare the two Epiſtles of <hi>Prosper</hi> and <hi>Hilary,</hi> with the two books of Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin de praedest. ſanctorum,</hi> and <hi>de bono per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverantiae,</hi> wherein he laboureth to anſwer thoſe two Epiſtles; to ſee to what he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth ſolid anſwer, to what he faileth, or what he ſlippeth untouched that is of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>(ſed hoc alias.)</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The Queſtion then is betweene the third and fourth propoſitions, and about the manner and meaſure of working Grace upon the Will or with it: whether it be ſuch, as <hi>poſitâ gratiâ operante,</hi> the Will may be Coworker or no, as the third propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion affirmeth, or whether <hi>poſitâ gratiâ operante,</hi> the worke of Grace is ſuch as the Will of Man cannot but be a Coworker, as the fourth propoſition maintaineth: That is to ſay, for the ſtate of a queſtion

                        </p>
                        <p>The iſſue will be that if <hi>Gratia Efficax</hi> do worke the Converſion and perſeverance of a Chriſtian, then all in vaine I have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputed before <hi>de Praedestinatione ſecundum praeſcientiam;</hi> which is therefore defended, becauſe it giveth place to freedome of Will, proper freedome in our working out our Salvation, which <hi>gratia Efficax</hi> utterly deſtroyes.</p>
                        <p>If <hi>Gratia Eſſiciens</hi> doe work our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, but not abſolutely alone, but with another co-worker which is free and Lord
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64487:76"/>
of its owne action, and may faile in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then there muſt needs be preſcience certaine of this contingent event, or elſe Predeſtination ſhall not be certaine, and then this doctrine of a ſinners converſion will well ſtand with the doctrine of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination after foreknowledge of all contingences, and this with that, as all parts of truth ought to agree one with another.</p>
                        <p>The queſtion in the uſefull termes is, (as ſome love to ſpeak) whether grace be reſiſtable? which word though it be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon <hi>Act.</hi> 7. 51. yet I had rather uſe words more frequent in the Scripture, whether Grace can be diſobeyed? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it can be in vaine? whether a man can be wanting to the grace of God, that hath him in hand to convert him, or to worke in him ſome good, as <hi>Act.</hi> 5. 32. and 6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 5. and 10. 16. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 13. and 10. 6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 1. and 5. 7. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 8.</p>

grants <hi>pag.</hi> 9. after much ſpoken <hi>pro libertate Arbitrii:</hi> Nos enim libere profitemur, &amp;c. <hi>For we freely profeſſe, neither operating, nor cooperating Grace, neither in Converſion, nor after Converſion, doth take away from mans Will, in the very exerciſe of its Elicite Act, the power of Reſiſting or diſſenting, if he will.

                        <p n="1">1. That a ſinner is paſſive in having the word of the Law and of the Goſpell
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:64487:82"/>
preached unto him; but active in hearing, and in attending to it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2.

                        <p n="3">3. That he is paſſive in receiving ſundry good thoughts, holy deſires, and a power to will, and motions to pray: But he is active in meditating on thoſe thoughts, in proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of thoſe deſires, and in endevouring to exerciſe his power to will and to pray; grace ready to help him, ever offering it ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. That praying hee is ſtill paſſive, but a willing Patient, thirſting for the gifts or habits of repentance, Faith, Love, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hee prayeth for; And active, but an helped Agent, in producing the acts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, believing, loving, out of thoſe gifts and habits infuſed into him.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. That hee is both paſſive under the vigilancy and power of God, protecting and keeping him being a believer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: and alſo active in watching over himſelfe with the grace of God to keepe, and defend himſelfe, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 18. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 33. Upon which place S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thus,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64487:83"/>
Videte quemadmodum non abſtulit libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum arbitrium, &amp;c. <hi>Behold after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner hee hath not taken away Freewill, when he ſaith,</hi> keepeth himſelfe chaſt<hi>: who is it that keepes us chaſt except God? But God doth not ſo keepe thee being unwilling thereto. Therefore when thou joyneſt thy will to God, thou keepeſt thy ſelfe Chaſt, Thou keepeſt thy ſelfe Chaſt, not of thy ſelfe, but by him who comes to dwell in thee: yet becauſe in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe thou doſt ſomething of thine owne will, therefore is ſomething attributed to thee; yet ſo is it aſcribed to thee, that ſtill thou mayſt ſay with the Pſalmiſt, Lord, be thou my helper:—If thou ſayſt, be thou my helper, thou doſt ſomething; for if thou didſt nothing, how could he helpe?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So then a ſinner is never firſt, but alwayes ſecond; not a Leader, but a Follower in every degree, and paſſage of his converſion. In the firſt entrance a meere Patient, in the ſecond progreſſe a willing Patient, in the third an Agent but an helped Agent, doing nothing alone without the adjuvant and cooperant Grace of God, ſaying (as it were a weake ſick man,) Now you have put life into mee, lift mee, and I will riſe; Stay me and I will ſtand; Draw me and I will come to you. <hi>Avertat enim Deus hanc amentiam, ut in donis ejus nos priores</hi>

This the Text ſaith not, or at leaſt this is the queſtion, whether under the aydes and meanes of faith com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to thee and to another, thou doe not make the difference when thou belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt and the other doth not. 2. <hi>Quia mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to minus fides homini tribui debet, ſi non cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſmata</hi>

                           <hi>ſibi comparare vel augere potest.</hi> This <hi>multo minus</hi> hath in it <hi>nihil minus;</hi> I demonſtrate it by a reaſon which the Remonſtrants did not, why this Text can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be applyed to gifts neceſſary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; Becauſe in them God wills not that difference which is betweene beleevers and unbeleevers under the word of faith, but would have all beleeve and obey the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell; this difference offendeth and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth God, and it proceedeth as much from the diſobedience of him that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not, as it doth from the obedience of him that beleeveth; but of that part of the difference which is by diſobeying, God I trow, is not the Author; It is ſinne and ſhame to him that wanteth faith after the meanes of faith afforded him, but no blame to him that ſpeaks not with tongues, or Prophecyeth not; Theſe were given ſuddenly and immediately without labour or meanes, but faith and the reſt needfull to Salvation, had meanes by which God gave them, about which meanes men might uſe a different diligence. When the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſpeak of Gods <hi>meaſuring to every man as he will,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 3. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 8. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 11. theſe places reſpect thoſe gifts of the holy Ghoſt that were given for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique ſervice of the Church<hi>:</hi> as if the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:64487:85"/>
that is of ſaving graces, to be ſo ſmall as it is, proceeded from mens negligence, rather than Gods diſpenſation: but admit that God putteth and approveth a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent meaſure, even of ſaving graces, yet that difference of an Emptineſſe and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of fayth in them that heare the word, he putteth not, he approveth not.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly, the difference in the meaſure of gifts of all ſorts, may come from God that giveth, but the different uſing of theſe gifts doth come from man, that is to reckon with God about the uſage of them: That one Servant received five, another two, another one Talent, this difference was from the Lord; but that one Servant gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed five, another two, another none, this difference was not from the Lord, but from the Servants; whence it is that one heareth, <hi>Euge ſerve bone &amp; fidelis,</hi> and another, <hi>Serve nequam, &amp; piger. Vid. Origen. ſuper Numeros, homil.</hi> 12.</p>
                        <p>Being ſecure of this place of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> I come with greater confidence to avoyd thoſe abſurdities, in preſſing of which ſome ſo much triumph; They ſay, that if man make the difference betweene himſelfe and another, then it followes,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That God doth no more for his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, than for the Reprobate.</p>

                           <pb n="262" facs="tcp:64487:86"/>
2. That the Saints have no more to give thanks to God for than the wicked.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That one man may glory againſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, for that he hath done ſomething more than another did.</p>
                        <p>To theſe I anſwer 1. in particular. 2. in generall.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To the firſt, admitting for a while that God in the grace of Vocation, doth no more for the Elect, than for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate, yet in the grace of Predeſtination he doth incomparibly more<hi>:</hi> In that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing the different ſucceſſes of his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and the Ends of the called ſo diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, he was pleaſed to decree and confirme that Calling to ſome which he foreknew would be ſaving to them; and to decree no other to the reſt than that which he foreſaw would not be ſaving to them, through their owne diſobedience, when it was in his power to have altered their Calling, to ſuch, as obedience (in his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) would have followed. So that in the Preparation, and in the Execution of his gracious Calling, which God knew would prove happily to theſe, his Election of them, and his love to them appeareth ſingular, and they have infinite reaſon of gratitude above the Reprobate; The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate have cauſe to thank God for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:64487:86"/>
that Calling, whereby they might have been ſaved as well as others are, and are to blame onely their owne contempt and folly: but they have not this to thank God for, that he did alter their Calling to a better, when he found the Event of this would be Evill unto them; neither can they blame him, ſeeing he was no way bound to doe ſo; for if he were, He ſhould not have ſuffered any to periſh at all. And the Elect who obey their Calling, which of them can tell in the preparation of their Calling how often God changed it, and amended it, (to ſpeak after our manner of Underſtanding, who uſe to bring things thus to perfection and to our liking) untill he had brought it to that order, as where of he ſaw the Effect would be the free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the Called.</p>
                        <p>But it was admitted onely, not affirmed, that in the Grace of Vocation God doth no more for the Elect than for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate: for what if the time wherein a Convert obeyeth, be not the firſt, ſecond, third, or the hundredth time that he hath <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Suffr.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;</hi> 4. <hi>theſi.</hi> 6.</note> beene called upon, but God hath ſhewed him that Patience, as one that would not give him over untill he win him? What if the time wherein the unconverted refuſed mercy, was but the firſt, ſecond, or the third,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:64487:87"/>
after which God in juſt ſeverity would no more move him by his Spirit, nor wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, but forſooke him? here is much inequality in Grace and favour: for it is enough for my ſuppoſition (of the liberty of mans Will under Grace, and of two e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually called, that one may obey and not another;) that ſometime two may be equally called, and unequally obey, though all that be called be not every one called as oft as another; for as we may ſuppoſe an equality in ſome, ſo doe we confeſſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite variety and inequality in moſt; yet there is a time when that hath place which our Church ſaith in the Homily of the knowledge of the Scripture, the ſecond part, pag. 5. <hi>That God receiveth the learned, and unlearned, and caſteth away none, but is indifferent unto all.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. To the ſecond I anſwer, for matter of thankfulneſſe: That as Grace is not therefore Grace, becauſe it is given to one, and denyed to another, but becauſe it is given the Unworthy, (for Grace were not the leſſe but the greater if it were given to all:) So my thanks are not therefore gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to God, becauſe he hath beene merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to me, more than to another, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath been mercifull to me unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; and my thanks are not diminiſhed,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:64487:87"/>
becauſe many more are partakers with me in the ſame benefits, but the greater, and ſhould have been yet greater, had more ſtill been partakers than are. Heare the words of <hi>Salvianus,</hi> or whoſoever be the Author, <hi>l.</hi> 2. <hi>ad Eccleſiam Catholicam prope à principio: Sed forſitan dicis, &amp;c. But hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily thou doſt ſay, there is a generall debt of all men touching theſe things of which we speak, and that all mankinde without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are obliged thereunto, (namely in the Paſſion of Chriſt;) we confeſſe it is Truth; Yet doth any man therefore owe the leſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe another alſo owes the like ſumme? &amp;c. That which I ſaid formerly, though it be a general debt, yet no queſtion it is alſo a special debt; although all men in common be enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, yet every one in particular is alſo bound: For Chriſt as he ſuffered for all, ſo he ſuffered for every one, and beſtowd himſelfe upon all, as well as upon every one; and gave himſelfe wholly for all, and wholly for every one. And in regard of this, whatever our Saviour by his ſuffering perform'd, as all owe themſelves wholly to him for it, ſo every one wholly: ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in respect of this every one owes more, than all Mankinde, becauſe every one hath reaped as much benefit thereby, as all men.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is a good rule for thankfulneſſe<hi>:</hi>
                           <pb n="266" facs="tcp:64487:88"/>
but take heede of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> forme of thanks for Graces, with compariſons to other folkes, <hi>Lord, I thank thee I am not like other men, or as this</hi> Publicane. Indeed, as ſome put the caſe of mankinde, like a company of Rebels, out of whom the King chooſeth whom he pleaſeth to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and executes the reſt with the ſword; thoſe pardoned owe thanks for their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and more thanks for culling them out, that were like to the reſt in Rebellion: But the Scripture puts not the caſe of mankinde ſo, but rather thus: God by the Goſpell as a King, mercifully proclames a generall pardon to all the company of Rebels in ſuch a County, upon condition, that he that comes in and yeelds his ſword, and takes at the Kings Pavilion a Ticket of his pardon, be free to goe home and enjoy the State of a good Subject, but they that ſtand out and refuſe this grace, be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch a day purſued with fire and ſword. They that ſubmit, magnifie the amplitude of the Kings mercy, ſorrow for ſuch as obſtinately ſtand out, juſtifie his Execution done upon ſtubborn, ungratefull Rebels. You think to win greater thanks to God, by amplifying his Grace upon one conſideration of ſparing ſome ſimply, but with prejudice to his Truth; proclamed
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:64487:88"/>
to all. I think to winne greater thanks to God by amplifying his Grace upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration of ſparing all upon fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable conditions, according to the Goſpell, the moſt wiſe comprehenſion of the Grace, Mercy, Juſtice, and Truth of the Almighty.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. To the third particular I anſwer, for matter of glorying: let this Rule ſtand firme, <hi>Qui gloriatur, in Domino glorietur, let him that glorieth, glory in the Lord,</hi> or let him not glory. Remember againe, that the gifts of God are either immediate, and proceeding from himſelfe alone, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, tongues, &amp;c. or mediate, and ſuch as proceede from Gods Grace and Mans will together, as I have declared; of thoſe immediate gifts there is no glorying, the latter part of the Text is ſtrong, <hi>What haſt thou, that thou haſt not received?</hi> and if thou haſt received, why boaſteſt thou as if thou hadſt not received? here <hi>accepiſſe</hi> excludes boaſting over another whoſe <hi>non-accepiſſe</hi> hath been no fault of his, it having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the meere will of the giver. But for gifts mediate, as Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and obedience in any particular du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they muſt be conſidered as <hi>Dona Dei,</hi> and as <hi>Debita à nobis,</hi> as the gifts of God &amp; as our duties; things neceſſary upon Gods
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:64487:89"/>
Commandement, and upon perill of our Salvation<hi>:</hi> as they are gifts of God wrought in us by his Grace, preventing, helping, and ſtrengthning us, there is no glorying of them but in the Lord: So <hi>Paul</hi> gloryeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 10. <hi>Plus omnibus labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravi, yet not I, but the Grace of God with me, which Grace was not in vaine,</hi> Phil. 4. 13. <hi>I have the art both to abound and to want,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I am able to doe all things,</hi>

                           </gap>, <hi>through Chriſt that ſtrengthneth me:</hi> here alſo <hi>accepiſſe</hi> excludes glorying in a mans ſelfe. Againe, the ſame gifts conſidered as duties owing by us, and as proceeding from the will of man (yet helped by Grace) are no matter of glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe they are done; S. <hi>Paul</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 16. <hi>Though I preach the Goſpel, I have nothing to glory of, for neceſſity is laid upon me, yea woe is me if I preach not the Goſpel:</hi> So woe is to me if I beleeve not the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel (doth the hearer ſay) <hi>accepiſſe</hi> is not the onely excluder of Glory, <hi>debuiſſe</hi> is as much<hi>: Luk.</hi> 17. 9. <hi>Doth he thank that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant becauſe he did the things that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him? I trow not; So likewiſe we, when we have done all thoſe things which are commanded us, ſay, Wee are unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;</hi> we have done that which was our duty to doe. What matter of boaſting is it
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:64487:89"/>
for a man to have kept himſelfe from a deteſtable crime, whereinto another ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, precipitated himſelfe to Hell? Yet I pray you doe not exclude all kinde of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, not that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> names ſo, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, &amp;c. The <hi>teſtimony of a good conſcience</hi> is ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſome joy that he wanteth who hath an Evill conſcience. Let Innocency waſh her hands without a check of Vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory: Let <hi>Samuel</hi> call witneſſe of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> record his owne good deeds, cap. 5. 15. <hi>The former Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours before mee had beene chargable to the People, even their ſervants bare rule over them: but ſo did not I, becauſe of the feare of the Lord.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In generall I anſwer to theſe three Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections: when things ſucceede well and proſperouſly unto us, whatſoever bee our naturall parts, whatſoever have beene our induſtry or our labour more than others, who is ſo voyd of piety or of underſtanding, that doth not aſcribe his good ſucceſſe unto God the Fountaine of all good, and the univerſall or principall cauſe of all happy events, who builds the houſe more than all that labour on it, who keeps the City above all that watch or ward, who gives more
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:64487:90"/>
to the increaſe than all that plant or water: yet the Builder, the Watchman, the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Waterer, have their parts and offices, which being neglected the houſe is not builded, the City is betrayed, the Tree is unfruitfull. Becauſe ſome little thing is done by men, but nothing comparable to that great which is done by God, therefore the forme of the Saints rejoycing is thus conceived, <hi>Not unto us O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give glory;</hi> that, <hi>not unto us,</hi> implies that ſomething hath beene done by us, and that mans corrupt heart is too ready to claime ſome glory to it ſelfe for it, but true Wiſdome and Piety ſoone removeth it, and ſaith, <hi>Not unto us O Lord, but to thy Name give glory.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Neither truly ſhould theſe poore things of the will of Man, whether wiſh or will, whether endeavour or labour, whether yeelding or obeying have been once named the ſame day that Gods Grace and Works are praiſed, or have beene pleaded or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for in theſe diſputes had not there beene a neceſſity compelling thereunto; <hi>Qui verò neceſſitate cogente vera de ſe bona loquitur, tantò magis veriùs humilitati jungitur, quantò &amp; veritati aſſociatur,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bern.

                        <p>Theſe things I was warned of long agoe by <hi>Melanchton,</hi> before the name of <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was heard of here, in his common places, <hi>cap. de Praedeſt.

                        <p>THis Chapter is an anſwer to another Objection.

                        <p>Hence proceeds that Doctrine of Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> of Grace and Faith, p. 13. <hi>That the ſeed of spirituall life, and the habits of Faith and Grace, (like a new Soule) are infuſed into men before they be ſo much as illuminated ſupernaturally, illumination going before the act of Faith, but not before the habit, or the grace of Sanctification in the Soule;</hi> So hee.

Firſt, the Univerſality of the change in qualities to be ſo diffuſed over the whole Man, <hi>ut non cognoſcas eundem eſſe,</hi> Chryſ. in 2 Cor. 5. Hom. 11. <hi>propter hoc &amp; craſſiore nomine vocat Reſurrectionem (ſive novam cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aturam) ut multam nobis mutationem &amp; varietatem oſtendat.</hi> That appeares by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> deſcriptions of the old and new Man, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. and by his parallels to this Text, Gal. 6. 17. <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus neither circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion avayleth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new creature.</hi> Gal. 5. 6. <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus neither circumciſion, nor uncircumciſion, but Faith that worketh by love.</hi> 1 Cor. 7. <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion is nothing, uncircumciſion is nothing, but the keeping of Gods Commandements.</hi> That's ſomething; where this makes up a new creature, Faith that worketh by love, or the keeping of Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, It reſpecteth <hi>the neceſſity</hi> of this change; <hi>except a man be borne againe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. firſt, in oppoſition to our firſt birth from <hi>Adam,</hi> by which wee are all ſinners, and excluded out of the Kingdom of God. But by Faith in Chriſt wee become to be in him as in a ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> and have from him righteouſneſſe and holineſſe, as reall, and avayleable to our entrance into the Kingdome of God, as our being borne
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:64487:93"/>
of <hi>Adam</hi> was avaylable to our excluding thence.</p>
                        <p>Next, in oppoſition to the <hi>Jewes</hi> boaſts of being the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as if that were enough to righteouſneſſe and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but if they be not borne againe by another birth, and that of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 13. they may be the children of the Devill, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, It reſpecteth the neceſſity of a <hi>divinum &amp; ſupernaturale principum,</hi> from whence this change muſt flow, elſe there is no hope for us ever to bee converted: Therefore, the Apoſtle having ſaid, <hi>Old things are paſt away, behold all things are become new,</hi> addeth, verſ. 18. <hi>and all things are of God, &amp;c. for it is hee that made us and not we our ſelves</hi> in both creations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. and wee are therefore <gap reason="foreign">

                        </p>
                        <p>There, the change is <hi>à non ente ad ens,</hi> here, <hi>à non tali ad tale.</hi>

                        <p>There, was never Creature heard ſay, Create me, renew mee O Lord<hi>:</hi> here one is heard crave, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>Create in mee a cleane heart O God, &amp; renew a right ſpirit within me.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>There, it was never ſaid to a Creature, make thy ſelf: here it is ſaid, <hi>Make you a new heart and a new spirit, for why will you die O houſe of Iſrael,</hi> Ezek. 18. 31. Jer. 4. 4. Eph. 5. 14.</p>
                        <p>There, was never any Creature blamed that was not made, nor reproved for being as it is: but here, to keepe on the old man, and not to put on the new, is imputed as a notorious fault in them that profeſſe Chriſt Jeſus and the Goſpel.</p>

                        <p>IN the yeare of the Lord, 1543. 35. <hi>H.</hi> 8. ſome three yeares before his death, there was publiſhed a Booke by the King, made by the Clergy, ſeene and very well liked by the whole Parliament, intituled, <hi>A ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Doctrine, and erudition for any Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian man, &amp;c.</hi> In which Booke there is a Declaration of the Article of <hi>Freewill,</hi> with the underſtanding whereof and ſome other points, the heads and ſenſes of the People in thoſe dayes were wuch imbuſied and travelled, ſaith the Preface. This Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I have tranſcribed wholly, not to preſſe the Reader with the authority of this Booke, for there are therein ſome few things of the error of former Times, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Authors rejoyce in God, and that worthily, for the light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

then manifeſted, in compariſon of the darkneſſe and ignorance of the former Times: But firſt to make uſe of the cautel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Expreſſion, and Declaration of this Article, compoſed by the beſt and ſoundeſt judgements of that Time; and ſecondly, what was the laſt and immediate Doctrine in this point that went before our Articles and Homilies in the beginning of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. and finding that Doctor <hi>Cranmer</hi> and ſome others were of the Clergy, in both Kings Reignes, and likely to have had their heads and hands in both theſe workes, it may well be preſumed, the difference not to be much in any matter of moment: Let it not bee troubleſome then for you to reade, that which was not tedious for me to write.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>Howbeit the ſtate and condition of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will was otherwiſe in our firſt Parents before they had ſinned, than it was either in them or their poſterity after they had ſinned: for our firſt Parents <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> untill they wounded and overthrew themſelves by ſinne,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:64487:95"/>
had ſo in poſſeſſion the ſaid power of Freewill, by the moſt liberall Gift and Grace of God their Maker, that not onely they might eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew all manner of ſinne, but alſo know God and love him, and fulfill all things appertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their felicity and wealth. For they were made righteous and to the Image and Similitude of God, having power of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will (as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith) to obey and diſobey: So that by obedience they might live, and by diſobedience they ſhould worthily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to dye. For the wiſe Man affirmeth that the ſtate of them was of that ſort in the beginning, ſaying thus, Eccluſ. 15. v. 14, 15. <hi>God in the beginning did create Man, and left him in the hands of his owne counſell; If thou wilt, to keepe the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to performe acceptable faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>From this moſt happy estate, our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents falling by diſobedience, moſt grievouſly hurt themſelves and their poſterity: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many other evills that came by that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, the high power of mans Reaſon and Freedome of will were wounded and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all Men thereby brought into ſuch blindneſſe and infirmity, that they cannot eſchew ſinne, except they be illuminated and made free by an especiall Grace, that is to ſay, by a ſupernaturall helpe, and working of
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:64487:96"/>
the Holy Ghoſt, which although the goodneſs of God offereth to all Men, yet they onely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it, which by their Freewill doe accept and embrace the ſame. Nor they alſo that bee holpen by the ſaid Grace, can accompliſh and performe things that be for their wealth, but with much labour and endeavour: So great is in our nature the corruption of the firſt ſinne, and the heavy burden bearing us downe to evill. For truly albeit the light of reaſon doth abide, yet it is much darkned, and with much difficulty doth diſcerne things that be inferiour and pertaine to this preſent life, but to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and perceive things that be spirituall, and pertaine to the everlaſting life, it is of it ſelfe unable. And ſo likewiſe, although there remaine a certaine freedome of will in thoſe things, which doe pertaine to the deſires and workes of this preſent life, yet to performe spirituall and heavenly things, Freewill of it ſelfe is inſufficient: and therefore the power of Mans Freewill being thus wounded and decayed, hath neede of a Phyſician to heale it, and an helpe to repaire it, that it may receive light and ſtrength whereby it may ſee, and have power to doe thoſe Godly and spirituall things, which before the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> it was able and might have done.</p>
                           <p>To this blindneſſe and infirmity of mans Nature, proceeding of originall ſinne, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:64487:96"/>
                              <hi>David</hi> had regard, when he deſired his <hi>eyes to be lightned of Almighty God, that he might conſider the marvelous things that be in his Law,</hi> Pſal. 119. 18. and alſo the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaying, <hi>Heale me O Lord, and I ſhall be made whole,</hi> Jer. 18. Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> alſo plainly declareth the ſame, ſaying, <hi>We conclude, that Freewill is in Man after his fall, which thing who ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth is not a Catholick man: but in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall deſires and works to pleaſe God, it is ſo weak and feeble, that it cannot either begin or performe them, unleſſe by the Grace and helpe of God it be prevented and holpen.</hi> And hereby it appeares that Mans ſtrength and Will in all things which be healthfull to the ſoule, and ſhall pleaſe God, hath need of Grace of the holy Ghoſt, by which ſuch spirituall things be inſpired into men, and ſtrength and conſtancie given to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them, if men doe not wilfully reſiſt the ſaid Grace offered unto them.</p>
                           <p>And likewiſe, as many things be in the Scriptures which doe ſhew Freewill to be in man, ſo there be no fewer places in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which doe declare the Grace of God to be ſo neceſſary, that if by it Freewill be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and holpen, it can neither doe nor will any thing that is good and Godly. Of which ſort be theſe Scriptures following; <hi>Without</hi>
                              <pb n="284" facs="tcp:64487:97"/>
                              <hi>me ye can doe nothing,</hi> John 15. <hi>No man commeth unto me except it be given him of the Father,</hi> John 6. <hi>We be not ſufficient of our ſelves, as of our ſelves, to think any good thing,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. According unto which Scriptures, and ſuch other like, it followes, that Freewill before it may think or will any good thing, muſt be holpen by the Grace of Chriſt, and by his Spirit be prevented, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, that it may be able thereto; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo made able, may freely thenceforth work together with Grace, and by the ſame ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, holpen and maintained, may doe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh good workes, and avoid ſinne, and perſevere alſo, and increaſe in Grace. It is ſurely of the Grace of God onely, that firſt we be inspired and moved to any good thing: but to reſiſt temptations, and to perſiſt in goodneſſe, and goe forward, it is both of the Grace of God, and of our Freewill and endeavour. And finally, after we have perſevered to the End, to be crowned with glory therefore, is the gift, and mercy of God, who of his bountifull good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe hath ordained, that reward to be given after this life, according to ſuch good works as be done in this life by his Grace.</p>
                           <p>Therefore men ought with much diligence and gratitude of mind, to conſider and regard the inſpirations and wholſome motions of the Holy Ghoſt, and to embrace the Grace of God,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:64487:97"/>
which is offered unto them in Chriſt, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth them to good things. And furthermore to goe about by all meanes to ſhew themſelves ſuch, as unto whom the Grace of God is not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in vaine; and when they doe feele that notwithſtanding their diligence, yet through their owne infirmity, they be not able to doe that they deſire, then they ought earneſtly, and with a fervent devotion, and ſtedfaſt faith, to aske of him who gave the beginning, that he would vouchſafe to performe it, which thing God will undoubtedly grant according to his promiſe to ſuch as perſevere in calling upon him, for he is naturally good, and willeth all men to be ſaved, and careth for them, and provideth all things by which they may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, except by their owne malice they will be evill, and ſo by righteous judgement of God periſh and be loſt. For truly men be to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the Authors of ſinne, and damnation, God is neither Author of ſinne, nor cauſe of damnation. And yet doth he moſt righteouſly damne thoſe men, that doe with vices corrupt their Nature, which he made good, and doe abuſe the ſame to evill deſires, againſt his moſt holy will: wherefore men be to be warned, that they doe not impute to God their vice or their damnation, but to themſelves, which by Freewill have abuſed the Grace and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of God.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="286" facs="tcp:64487:98"/>
All men alſo be to be moniſhed, and chiefly Preachers, that in this high matter, they looking on both ſides, ſo attemper and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate themſelves, that they neither ſo preach the Grace of God that they take away thereby Freewill: nor on the other ſide, ſo extoll Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will, that injury be done to the Grace of God.</p>

                        <p>The ſecond <hi>Text</hi> of Scripture is that of <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 21. 26. 27. which by no evaſion can be avoyded, if the compariſon there betweene a righteous man and a wicked be well obſerved<hi>:</hi> for deny you any-wiſe that a righteous man can turne away from his righteouſneſſe and dy; and I will deny like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that a wicked man can turne from his wickedneſſe and live; and ſo we ſhall <hi>ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Scripturas,</hi> make voyd the holy Word of God; if a ſuppoſition putteth nothing in the one, it putteth nothing in the other:
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:64487:102"/>
if the wicked there whom the Text ſpeakes of, be truly and Legally a wicked man, then the righteous there is truly and Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally a righteous man, for Legally righteous the Scripture knowes but one: if it bee ever ſeene that a wicked man turnes from his wickednes and lives, then it may as well be ſeene that a righteous man turnes from his righteouſnes and dyes.</p>
                        <p>To theſe places I finde no anſwer made by our Divines at <hi>Dort,</hi> from whom I hoped for ſatisfaction in all things: but to divers others as, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5. &amp; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. and ſuch like, they frame this anſwer; That ſuch places ſpeake of initiall and precedaneall degrees of Faith, not of true juſtifying Faith; men but entred a little may goe back, but not they that have attained unto true Faith<hi>:</hi> yet ſuch beginners ſay they, are to be counted in the viſible Church for true believers and juſtifyed perſons.

                        <p>From hence it is, that the renewing of theſe men againe by Repentance is ſo hard, or impoſſible, that fell from ſo great an height, whereas to be renewed after leſſer faults is ordinary: How will theſe Divines of the Schoole ſatisfie weake ones, and our common Chriſtians of the Country, in whom they ſhall not finde ſo much as theſe things which they call <hi>initialls?</hi> how will they perſwade them, that they are in the ſtate of Regeneration, and have that juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith, whereof they ſay Believers may be aſſured; or will they exclude them out of the rank of Believers?</p>

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:64487:103"/>
which muſt not bee refuſed by any replyer, <hi>De corrept. &amp; grat. cap.</hi> 8. Mirandum eſt quidem, multumque mirandum, &amp;c. <hi>It is to be wondered at, and very marvelous, that God ſhould not give Perſeverance to ſome of his Children, whom hee hath Regenerated in Chriſt, and to whom hee hath given Faith, Hope and Love; when as he forgives ſo great wickedneſſe to other ſtrange Children, and makes them his Sonnes by conferring his Grace upon them, &amp;c.</hi> The thing that S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> admireth, is, Cur illos Deus, &amp;c. <hi>why God ſhould not then ſnatch away thoſe his children, which have lived faithfully and godlily, out of the danger of this preſent life, leſt their evill inclinations ſhould worke a change in their mindes.</hi> And hee refers this to the inſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table judgements of God, moſt wiſely and holily<hi>:</hi> But his Opinion is, that if theſe men had dyed in that time when they lived juſtly and piouſly, they had beene ſaved, therefore their faith was more than begun, they were more than ſeeming Chriſtians, they were truly juſtifyed and ſanctifyed, and then fit for the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
                        <p>4. Laſtly, I maintaine and preſcribe this to be the publike Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> by Law eſtabliſhed: and firſt, Heare King <hi>Henries</hi> Proteſtations in the Booke before praiſed; In the Article of

                           <p n="2">2. For the ſecond way, by Analyſing the Propoſitions, &amp;c. thus I proceede: The Title is of <hi>Sin after Baptiſme:</hi> Cleerly it is not the ſcope of any part of this Article (as ſome would have it) to define and declare that all men doe ſinne, even thoſe that are Baptized and borne againe in Chriſt, for this was done already in the next precedent Article, <hi>Chriſt alone with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinne, &amp;c.

                              <hi>offend in many things.</hi> This need not to be ſaid againe. But the ſcope of this, is to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine ſomething about the meaſure, degree, demerit of ſinne after Baptiſme, and to condemne the exceſſes and extremities of Opinions in this point, ſome aggravating this ſinne too much, ſome extenuating it, and making of it too little: for theſe there be here two Propoſitions definitive, and two Concluſions derived out of the Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. Againſt the extreme rigour of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatus, Not every deadly ſinne willingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited after Baptiſme, is ſinne againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, and unpardonable.</hi> There is the firſt definition: The Concluſion hence is, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the grant of Repentance is not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed unto ſuch as fall into ſin after Baptiſme,</hi> and therefore they are to be condemned which <hi>deny place of forgiveneſſe to ſuch as truly repent:</hi> This is a mitigation of one exceſſe and rigor of Opinion, and a ſtay to weak ones and fearfull.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The ſecond Propoſition is, <hi>After we have received the Holy Ghoſt, we may depart from Grace given, and fall into ſinne, and by the Grace of God we may riſe againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend our lives.</hi> This is the Definition: The Concluſion hence is, Therefore they are to be condemned that ſay, <hi>They can no more</hi>
                              <pb n="302" facs="tcp:64487:106"/>
                              <hi>ſin as long as they live here.</hi> This is againſt another extremity of certaine <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> that dreamed of ſuch a perfection as of not ſinning; and of other <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> (for there was an 100. confuſions among them,) that eſteemed all manner of foule actions done by them that had received the Holy Ghoſt, to be in them no ſinnes, or not to be reckoned ſo; to whom our men incline that hold, no ſinnes in the regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to impeach their juſtification, or ſtate of Salvation: which this branch of the Article doth directly oppoſe, ſaying, <hi>that they which doe ſo fall or ſinne, are departed from Grace, and need to riſe againe by Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Now for amending or explaning theſe termes, if it ſhould be done as King <hi>James</hi> left it to be conſidered, <hi>pag.</hi> 30. of the aforeſaid Conference, by putting in the word <hi>(Often)</hi> or the like, <hi>(We may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten depart from Grace,</hi> or <hi>we may depart farre from Grace,)</hi> This I think would little content them, ſince the <hi>Pſalme</hi> ſaith, 73. 27. <hi>Ecce qui ſe elongant à te, peribunt; ſuccîdis omnem fornicantem à te.</hi> But if the amendment were made by putting in, <hi>we may depart from Grace, yet neither finally nor totally,</hi> then this alſo had beene a clauſe of Mitigation, and had not pinched them a whit againſt whom it was provided, nay, it
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:64487:106"/>
had made this propoſition all one with the former; for what difference is there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two, <hi>Every deadly ſin willingly committed after Baptiſme, is not ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt,</hi> (and) <hi>After we have received the holy Ghoſt, we may depart from grace, but not finally or totally,</hi> ſeeing this is true, that the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt is no other than a totall or finall departing from Grace? And whereas the <hi>Deane of Pauls</hi> uſed this exception of <hi>Finally</hi> and <hi>Totally, pag.</hi> 41. of the Conference; he doth it of thoſe that are called according to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Gods Election, and not of all that are called or juſtified. But our 16. Article ſpeaketh not of the Elect onely, for it ſaith, <hi>We may riſe againe by the grace of God;</hi> whereas if it ſpake onely of the Elect, it muſt have ſaid, <hi>We ſhall riſe againe by the grace of God:</hi> and ſo muſt they that would have put in, <hi>not finally, nor totally.</hi>

                           <p>Neither doth the 17. Article treating of Gods Election any thing contradict this 16. as Dr. <hi>R.</hi> feared; for although it affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that all <hi>predeſtinate to life are called and justified, &amp;c.</hi> yet it doth not ſay that all that are called and juſtified, and made the ſons of God, be predeſtinate to life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Perſeverance to the End is preſumed, where Gods purpoſe is predeſtinating to

life. But that Article we ſhall alſo cleare, and ſhew the conſiſting of theſe two full well without contradiction.</p>
                           <p>Thus of the Article in Branches and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; now let me note ſomething out of words and termes: Firſt, here is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and yeelded, that after Baptiſme we may ſin willingly. Secondly, that ſuch aſin is a deadly ſin, in phraſe of the Fathers, and in the ſenſe of <hi>Melanchton, Loco de diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne peccati mortalis &amp; venialis.</hi> 3. That this ſin is not ſin againſt the holy Ghoſt, but neere it, great; and fearfull, elſe it need not have been ſevered from it, and a ſtay made for ſcrupulous and timorous conſciences, and to the ſeverity of the rigorous. 4. That though ſuch a ſinne be pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet it requireth great, deep, bitter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, in a manner ſuch as the ancient Church required in the ſolemne reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>lapſorum,</hi> to obtaine pardon of God. 5. That the phraſe <hi>to depart from grace,</hi> is not diminutive, nor a mitigation, but an aggravation of the ſin; That after the holy Ghoſt received, a man ſhould depart from grace given, is a grievous thing. <hi>In hoc enim quiſ<expan>

                           <p>Other doctrine of our Church of like nature to this, is found in the booke of Homilies, eſpecially in that which is intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Of declining from God,</hi> in the Table,

                           <p>In the ſecond tome, in the Homily of <hi>Repentance,</hi> the firſt part, <hi>pag.</hi> 261, 262. there is a full paraphraſe upon the 16. Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle according to the two parts I made of

it, too much to write out; admitting that we may chance after we be once come to God, and be grafted into his Son Jeſus Chriſt, to fall into ſome horrible Sinne, and yet be received againe into favour, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining that the Sin againſt the holy Ghoſt is a finall faling away from Chriſt; that the promiſes of mercy to them that turne to God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4. <hi>Iſay</hi> 55. <hi>Oſee</hi> 6. ought to be underſtood of them that were with the Lord before, and by their ſinnes and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe were gone away from him; that <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> were juſtified, yet fell horribly, but by repentance were forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, the prayers of the Church have ever beene a place from which Arguments have beene drawne, thus; Againſt them that ſay the Regenerate may be perfect without ſinne, Why then doth our Lord teach them to pray, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes?</hi> againſt them that ſay, they cannot be tempted to evill to be overcome, why doth he teach us to ſay, <hi>Leade us not into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but deliver us from evill?</hi> So <hi>Jerome</hi> 2. <hi>lib.

                        <p>Here I will firſt argue <hi>ex conceſſis,</hi> and then reſt in one argument out of the Scripture.</p>

may not forſake their party altogether: That which I object is, that the things which they deny cannot ſtand together with the things they grant.</p>
                        <p>1. They ſay firſt, <hi>Though the Regenerate ſo ſinning be guilty, yet they are in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God to be abſolved.</hi>

Truth it is, that in the Sacraments inſtituted by Chriſt, we may conſtantly believe the Works of God in them to our preſent comfort, and application of his grace and favour, with aſſurance alſo that he will not faile us, if we fall not from him; wherefore ſo continuing in the ſtate of Grace with him, we may believe undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſaved. But foraſmuch as our own frailty and naughtineſſe ought ever to be feared in us, it is therefore expedient for us to live in continuall watch, and continuall fight with our Enemies, and not preſume too much of our Perſeverance and continuance in the ſtate of Grace, which on our behalfe is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and unſtable; for although Gods Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes made in Chriſt be immutable, yet hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth</hi>

<pb n="332" facs="tcp:64487:121"/>
to obey the Goſpell, and perhaps have by Baptiſme that ſinnes forgiveneſſe ſealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, as it ſeemed ſtrange to Doctor <hi>Whitakers,</hi> that any man ſhould be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated for that ſinne which is forgiven him; ſo it ſeemeth ſtrange to mee, that thoſe ſinnes ſhould be alleged againſt a man, for which hee is condemned, and yet for which he was not Reprobated, ſince the ſentence of Reprobation is the heavieſt and moſt wofull ſentence that can be, as that which drawes after it the ſentence of Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the fourth Aſſertion at <hi>Lambeth</hi> ſaith.

Or how doth it more burden the guilty to heare of their ſeveral crimes, when they all were rejected in the common caſe of mankinde fallen, and from thenceforth unable to ariſe and amend, having neither Saviour to die for them, nor Spirit to call them, nor helpe to heale them, all which Reprobation hath excluded and debarred them from, or theſe from them? God will
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:64487:121"/>
overcome in judgement, but not by plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his prerogative, or his Soveraigne power, or by putting men to ſilence with his greatneſſe, (elſe <hi>Abraham</hi> was too bold to expoſtulate with God, <hi>ſhall not the Judge of the whole earth doe right?)</hi> but by Juſtice and equity; elſe, hee would not offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to be tryed, <hi>Iſay</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Iudge I pray you, betwixt mee and my Vineyard, what could I have done more to my Vineyard, that I have not done in it?</hi> God will convince the ungodly, and put them to ſilence and ſhame by their unthankfulneſſe and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſſe againſt his abundant goodneſſe, patience, and long-ſuffering ſhewed unto them.</p>

<pb n="336" facs="tcp:64487:123"/>
of ſimple, or meere Underſtanding, that is called alſo <hi>ſcientia libera,</hi> becauſe it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſome free act of the Will of God; this is called <hi>Naturalis,</hi> Naturall; becauſe it is in God, who is of Infinite Underſtanding, before any act of his Will be ſuppoſed to have paſſed.</p>
                           <p>His <hi>knowledge of Viſion,</hi> or of ſight, is onely of thoſe things which either have, or ſhall have a being, and therefore this knowledge is after Predeſtination, and builded upon it; for when Predeſtination hath decreed what things ſhall be, then God by his Underſtanding of Viſion doth know them, as beholding them<hi>:</hi> Seeing then this knowledge is after Predeſtination is finiſhed and concluded, it hath no place in the Act of God predeſtinating; neither can any thing that is under ſuch knowledge or ſight, be any cauſe or rule of Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: whence it appeareth that <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. <hi>Whom he foreknew he did predeſtinate,</hi> ſuch foreknowledge of Viſion cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, ſeeing there Foreknowledge goes before Predeſtinating, as Predeſtinating goes before Calling, and Calling before Juſtifying: So that they ſpeak improperly, that uſe the termes of <hi>praeviſa fides,</hi> for <hi>fides Praecognita,</hi> in the Queſtion, <hi>whether Faith foreknown have any place in Gods Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination:</hi>
                              <pb n="337" facs="tcp:64487:123"/>
with this knowledge then of <hi>Viſion,</hi> we have no more to doe in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                           <p>Gods knowledge of <hi>pure</hi> or <hi>ſimple <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> is of the ſame things that are predeſtinate to be, but before they were predeſtinated, and of infinite things more, beſides them: all which it underſtood and compared together, before any thing was decreed or determined to be.</p>
                           <p>This knowledge is founded on Gods Omnipotency, for he knoweth his owne power, and ſo it is of things but as poſſible to be, if he pleaſe to give them being: and he knoweth alſo by this his Underſtanding (if he pleaſe to give them being) what will be their Operations and effects, and what may flow or iſſue from them, either as they are Naturall Agents or Voluntary: So by this meanes the knowledge of God ariſeth to an infiniteneſſe, and <hi>to be without number,</hi> as the <hi>Pſalm.</hi> ſaith, 147. 5. But if it ſhould be limitted to theſe things alone, which have a being, and are within the circle of heaven, or within the compaſſe of the ages of the world, the knowledge of God ſhould in a ſort be finite, ſince theſe things though to us they be many, yet certainly they are finite.</p>
                           <p>Now the firſt act of Predeſtination was
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:64487:124"/>
in chooſing theſe things to be which now are, and the decree to put them into being, refuſing and rejecting infinite other things, which God knew as poſſible as theſe, and which might have beene, if it had pleaſed him. But of this predeſtination of all things that are, and the rejection of ſuch things as are not, our inquiry and diſpute is not, but of Angels and Men that have a being, in what order and manner ſome were prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated to life, and ſome rejected. To which my anſwer is, that this was not done without that ſelfe-ſame foreknowledge of ſimple Underſtanding of this part of the world, Angels and Men, which was uſed in the predeſtinating of the whole;</p>
                           <p>That is to ſay;</p>
                           <p n="1">1. That God did Underſtand, that if it pleaſed him to create among other his glorious workes, ſome creatures endued with reaſon, and of a free Nature, they would be more fit than the reſt for him to ſhew forth in them his wiſdome, goodneſſe, bounty, juſtice, mercy, fidelity, and all his glorious properties, yet it remained at his pleaſure to create them or not.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. That he did underſtand, that ſuch creatures according to their freedome would vary in their choices, ſome cleaving faſt to good, ſome declining to evill; he
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:64487:124"/>
knew this not onely in generall, and as poſſible, but particularly the very perſons (if they were created, and put to the tryall) yet it remained at his pleaſure to create them, or to try them, or no, to permit or hinder any of them in their choices, which he knew how to doe if he would.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. That he did underſtand, that of them whom he knew would forſake their firſt good eſtate (if he permitted them) hee might juſtly forſake ſome, and puniſh them for their rebellion: or he could find means to reſtore them, and reconcile them to himſelfe<hi>:</hi> but yet he determined nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                           <p n="4">4. That he underſtood that it might be more juſtifiable and equall, not to ſpare Angels, but to ſhew mercy to Men, as more fraile and weake, as alſo deceived by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; Yet he would conſider what to doe.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. That he underſtood, that if he ſhould out of that mercy, provide excellent meanes, ſufficient to raiſe men fallen, and to reſtore to them power and freedome to work like reaſonable and free Agents, in the Uſe of thoſe meanes to their Salvation; he underſtood, I ſay, that among many ſome would thankfully receive his mercy, ſome ungratefully reject it, for the ſake of
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:64487:125"/>
the pleaſures of ſin: the very particulars he knew, of al his own mercies in their ſeveral degrees and varieties, of all the Perſons in their ſeverall conditions and events: but ſtill the determination what ſhould be done, or permitted of all this, was as it were held in ſuſpence.</p>
                           <p n="6">6. That he underſtood, that if he ſhould condemne them, that had refuſed his many mercies, and ſhould receive them to favour that returned to him, he ſhould doe juſtly to the one, and mercifully to the other, and judge them all righteouſly. But all theſe things, underſtood from the firſt to the laſt, from the beginning to the end of the world, with every particular circumſtance (the ſame that now are under execution) I ſay underſtood them as under condition, and with ſuppoſition, if it ſhall pleaſe the Soveraigne Lord to determine and decree to put them into being, and into act, were brought, and preſented to the wiſdome, counſell, and will of God, to allow or amend, to approve or to alter, or to decree and eſtabliſh them for ever; which after long and deep contemplation (that we may ſtill ſpeak after our poore manner of Underſtanding) it pleaſed the onely wiſe God, and Lord of all, upon them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce this mighty word or decree, <hi>Fiant,</hi>
                              <pb n="341" facs="tcp:64487:125"/>
                              <hi>let them be ſo:</hi> This frame, this Order, theſe Cauſes with their Effects, theſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, theſe Mercies, theſe Judgements, theſe Ends, glory to ſome, ſhame to others; Let them be eſtabliſhed and ratified to the glory of the divine wiſdome, juſtice, Grace, power and holineſſe; Amen, Amen, Amen, ſaid the bleſſed and eternall Trinity.</p>
                           <p>Thus the <hi>Will</hi> of God comming to his <hi>knowledge</hi> maketh the Decree of Predeſtination, which Knowledge or Underſtanding alone doth not.</p>
                           <p>Of this <hi>Will</hi> of God we are further to conſider an eſſentiall property of it, and a neceſſary diſtinction.</p>
                           <p>The Property of the <hi>Will</hi> of God is to be free, abſolute, independent, to proceed out of no cauſe, but out of himſefe; in ſo much as even his occaſioned will had liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty not to have taken the occaſion: from whence it followeth, that the things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate cannot be cauſes or motives of their predeſtination, neither are things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate out of Preſcience of ſimple under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſuch, for therein all things were knowne yet but as poſſible, and having no ſubſiſtence at all, being as poſſible never to be, they could not be movers of Gods Will to will them. They are deceived therefore that think Predeſtination out of Preſcience,
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:64487:126"/>
makes Gods will to depend on Mans Will, or to be a conditionall or uncertaine Will; nay, a decree out of this Preſcience of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple underſtanding concludes Gods Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination to be as abſolute, free, certaine, infallible, as his Omniſcience is infallible, and his Will free, and his Power ſupreme, or as any other way or manner of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this myſterie can conclude it.</p>
                           <p>The Diſtinction of the <hi>Will</hi> of God is that of <hi>Damaſcen</hi> out of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> into his Antecedent, and Conſequent Will: That is his chiefe and primary Will, proceeding out of himſelfe, or out of his owne good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and therefore is called by <hi>Anſelme, The will of his Mercy;</hi> This other is his occaſioned will, or the will of his Juſtice, as the cauſe now ſtandeth: Out of the firſt proceedeth all the good of Grace and Glory, which the reaſonable creature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth; Out of the ſecond proceedeth all the evill of Puniſhment and Revenge (for the evill of Chaſtiſement may proceed from love, and ſo from the firſt Will, as good) that an offender ſuffereth or endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth. From the firſt of theſe floweth that part of Predeſtination, which is to Life; which decreeth to give thoſe meanes and benefits, which underſtanding knowes will be ſaving to ſuch men, if they be given
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:64487:126"/>
them, which is the very <hi>decree of Election.</hi> From the ſecond of theſe floweth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of Predeſtination, which is to Wrath; which decreeth to give but thoſe meanes and benefits which foreknowledge underſtandeth will faile to be ſaving to ſome men, through their extreme fault, and to inflict Death upon them for their fault, which is the <hi>Decree of Reprobation.</hi> And thus much is enough of the Will of God.</p>

                           <p>From hence an anſwer is given to any that ſhall aske a reaſon, Why God allowed and alotted unto theſe men the meanes which he foreknew would bring them to Glory, and ſetled the End, Glory and Eternall life upon them? and why he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any at all to periſh, or why theſe rather than others, when he foreknew their Ends would be unhappy through their

                           <p>The Anſwer, I ſay, to this is, out of the <hi>Dominion</hi> of God, that it was his high plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to have his Juſtice manifeſted, as well as his Mercy, and his Juſtice in theſe, as his Mercy in thoſe, out of the ſame his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, without wrong or injuſtice to any, with free &amp; frank bounty to others, as Lord of his owne things.

                           <p>Here is to be ſeen that Maſſe or lump of Mankinde, out of which the great Potter made Veſſels to honour, and to diſhonour, namely the whole race of men, from the firſt man to the laſt, under all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances accompanying every particular both on Gods part, and alſo on Mans, knowne and conſidered by the Naturall
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:64487:127"/>
and ſimple underſtanding of God: for then they were as a Lumpe without deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined formes, capable of any change, or amendment, which the great workmaſter might pleaſe to have<hi>:</hi> For as God by his Soveraigne power, makes of the ſame Earth ſome peece gold, ſome lead, or baſer ſtuffe; ſo of Mankinde, he made ſome to holineſſe and honour, ſome he permitted to be defiled and come to diſhonour: But with this difference, that there his own hand did all, as working upon a dead and ſenſeleſſe matter, here he worketh upon a living and reaſonable creature, whoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we muſt ſuppoſe and provide to be preſerved in Gods working upon it: for in compariſons, as there muſt be ſome like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſo the differences muſt be marked, as the Nature of things compared doe differ, elſe nothing is more fit to deceive with, than a ſimilitude.</p>
                           <p>Thus much for the Conſideration of the Nature of God, who did Predeſtinate: there followeth the conſideration of the Nature of Man, who was Predeſtinated.</p>
                           <p>It pleaſed the moſt wiſe and omnipotent Creator, amongſt other his glorious works, to conceive one more admirable and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than the reſt; To ſubſiſt of a mixt &amp; compound Nature, of Spirit and of fleſh.
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:64487:128"/>

                           <p>This perhaps may be ſaid to be true of the firſt man <hi>Adam,</hi> in his Creation; but ſince his fall, that freedome of man is to all kind of things decayed, and to things Spirituall utterly loſt: which being granted, yet this is to be added; That God who knew and permitted this fall, and loſſe, knew alſo how to provide, and to prepare graces of his powerfull Spirit, to reſtore
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:64487:128"/>
and ſupply that which was loſt, and how to give a new Commandement, or make a new Covenant with man fallen, fit and proportionable to the impotent will of Man, and to thoſe graces of his Spirit, which he would be ever ready to ſupply, either preventing man, or working in him, or aſſiſting, helping, protecting, preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, as need ſhall require: So that this Noble creature ſtill might hold and keepe the place and ranke of a free Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                           <p>For we may not think that the wiſdome of God made ſuch an one to ſhew him to the Angels, and to the world, and ever after to have baniſhed him out of the world: or to have admitted ſo notorious a defect in this Univerſe, that there ſhould not be found in it, the nobleſt Nature of things here below, above a day or two, in the very infancy of the world; and ever af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter men ſhould all either be neceſſarily evil, or neceſſarily good, after the <hi>Maniches</hi> hereſie, ſeeing God created man to be the Subject of his righteous Judgement: The old ſaying therefore muſt be remembred; <hi>If there be not the Grace of God, how ſhall God ſave the world? If there be not Freewill in Man, how ſhall God judge the world?</hi> Grace is to be defended ſo, as we doe not
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:64487:129"/>
ſubvert the freedome of mans Will, and the Freewill of man is to be defended ſo, that we doe not evacuate the Grace of God.</p>
                           <p>To conclude with uniting the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe two Natures together of God and man, in our conceiving the Order and manner of the divine Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                           <p>Seeing the Nature of a free creature is the Subject and the roote of moſt contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency in the world, and the Natural know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, or his ſimple Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the infallible foreknower of all future contingents, even conditionall, if God pleaſe to create ſuch a free Creature; it followeth from hence, that a juſt Decree before all time, what ſhall become of every free Creature in the end of time, cannot poſſibly be conceived by us to have beene made, but as proceeding from that infallible foreknowledge, which is in God, of every mans workes, ſince he <hi>will render to every man according to his workes.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And againe, becauſe the ſame Decree doth proceede from a Soveraigne Lord, whoſe Will is abſolute, who will be debtor to none, but will have all debtors to him; it followeth againe, that the foreknowlege out of which the Decree proceedeth, can
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:64487:129"/>
be no other (after our manner of Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding) than that of Gods Naturall, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple underſtanding of things, when they were but as poſſible, before any Decree was made, that they ſhould be created or come into being.

                        <p>In doing whereof I deſire the judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reader to conſider with mee three things.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Scope</hi> and <hi>Intent</hi> of the Article.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Paragraphs</hi> with their Connnexion.</p>
                        <p n="3">3.

                        <p n="1">1. The <hi>Scope</hi> of the Article is,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. To eſtabliſh an Unity of Doctrine
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:64487:130"/>
in the high point of Predeſtination and Election, among the members of this Church.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To direct them to the right uſe of this Doctrine, and to prevent abuſes.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The <hi>Parts</hi> and <hi>Paragraphs</hi> diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed to the Eye in moſt Editions are two.</p>
                        <p>The firſt from the beginning to theſe words, <hi>They attaine to everlaſting fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity:</hi> This hath reſpect chiefly to the Firſt end, the eſtabliſhing of the ſound Doctrine of Predeſtination.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond beginneth at theſe words, <hi>As the Godly conſideration, &amp;c.</hi> and reacheth to the End: This hath reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect chiefly to the Second; To direct the Church in the direct uſe of this Doctrine, and to avert abuſes and ſcandals.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The <hi>loweſt</hi> and <hi>particular termes</hi> will come to be conſidered in their own places, as they lye in every Paragraph.</p>
                        <p>The firſt Paragraph that concerneth Doctrine hath two Branches:</p>
                        <p>The firſt, the Definition of Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond the Deſcription of the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and Manifeſtation thereof.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="352" facs="tcp:64487:131"/>
The firſt branch, the Definition is ſet downe in theſe termes; <hi>Predestination to Life is the Everlasting purpoſe of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by before the Foundation of the World was layd, he hath conſtantly decreed by his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, ſecret to us, to deliver from curſe and damnation thoſe whom he hath choſen in Chriſt out of Mankinde; and to bring them by Chriſt to everlaſting Salvation, as Veſſels made to Honor.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here be two things to be conſidered <hi>The thing defined. The Definition.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The thing defined is <hi>Predeſtination to life,</hi> which very terme admits another Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, which is to death; though the Article ſay nothing expreſly of it, or of Reprobation. Not as if God decreed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing what to doe with wicked men, or had not a purpoſe to glorifie his Juſtice in them, or were not certaine in his knowledge, who and which they would be: nor as if the Church ſhund to touch upon that ſtring as harſh and unpleaſant: (The Doctrine of Reprobation being as profitable to drive men from the wayes of wickedneſſe that lead to perdition, as the Doctrine of Predeſtination is profitable to draw men into the wayes of righteouſneſſe, being rightly underſtood<hi>:)</hi> But the reaſon why the Article ſayes nothing directly of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination</hi>
                           <pb n="353" facs="tcp:64487:131"/>
                           <hi>to death,</hi> or of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> is, becauſe it is eaſily underſtood by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, whereof the Article ſaith ſo much: for if Predeſtination to Life be the purpoſe of God to deliver from curſe; then Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination to Death muſt be the purpoſe of God not to deliver from curſe and damnation thoſe whom hee hath not <hi>found in Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. 5. but to caſt them into everlaſting fire as Veſſells to diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>
                        <p>The Definition followeth; That <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination to life is the everlaſting purpoſe of of God, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Here I crave leave for cleare underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſever and put aſunder the eſſentiall parts of the Definition from the Adjuncts and ornaments that are annexed to every ſeverall eſſentiall part, to make every part more compleat, perfect and comely.</p>
                        <p>The ſubſtance of the Definition is this; <hi>Predeſtination to life is the purpoſe of God to bring to ſalvation thoſe whom hee hath choſen.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <list>
                           <head>Here are three things:</head>
                           <item>1. An inward Act, <hi>his Purpoſe.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>2. An outward Act, or End purpoſed, <hi>To bring to ſalvation.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>3. The ſubject upon which the purpoſe ſettles the outward Act or End, <hi>Thoſe whom he hath choſen.</hi>

To every one of theſe there are ſeverall Adjuncts, making them more full; as to the Purpoſe of God is adjoyned,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That it is an <hi>Everlaſting purpoſe before the foundation, &amp;c.</hi>

                        <p n="2">2. That it is a Purpoſe <hi>whereby hee hath decreed;</hi> So it is a Decree aſwell as a Purpoſe.</p>

                        <p>The outward Act or End purpoſed, <hi>To bring to Salvation,</hi> hath theſe adjections or amplifications:</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The ſtate and <hi>Terminus à quo,</hi> from whence theſe are brought, from curſe and damnation; To <hi>deliver from curſe.</hi>

                        </p>

                        </p>
                        <p>To the Subject upon whom the purpoſe ſetleth the outward Act or End,</p>

                           <head>The <hi>Choſen,</hi> theſe things are added.</head>
                           <item>1. That they were <hi>choſen in Chriſt.</hi>

                        <p>Thus you have the eſſentiall parts of the Definition, and the Adjuncts to every part, which I ſeparate not, as if the Adjuncts might be ſpared in the Definition, but onely for the clearer contemplation of them being ſevered and ſingled one from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>Now if I take theſe againe into conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, I muſt joyne to every of the three principals his acceſſories alſo, as I have layd them out.</p>
                        <p>And here ſome man would thinke, I were bound to begin with the firſt thing named in the Definition, The <hi>everlaſting purpoſe of God:</hi> but I can give him a reaſon why I muſt doe otherwiſe<hi>:</hi> for in the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall and Grammaticall conſtruction of the Article, there is here expreſſed one higher, prior, eternall Act of God, <hi>viz. to have choſen ſome out of Mankinde in Chriſt,</hi> before the other act of his Purpoſe or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, <hi>to deliver from curſe, and to bring to</hi>
                           <pb n="356" facs="tcp:64487:133"/>
                           <hi>Salvation thoſe whom hee hath choſen:</hi> for though in truth both theſe be coeternall, yet in order of nature (after our manner of underſtanding, and by the words of our Article) one is before the other; <hi>chooſing in Chriſt,</hi> before purpoſe to <hi>bring to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> for the purpoſe is <hi>to bring to Salvation thoſe whom hee hath choſen</hi> (ſaith our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,) which is agreeable to the words of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>purpoſe is according to Election, Rom.</hi> 9. 11. but that which is according to another, is after that according to which it is framed: ſo if wee ſhall place things according to due order (and of order is our principall iniquiry,) Predeſtination to Life may be thus defined; <hi>Gods chooſing of ſome in Chriſt out of Mankinde before the Foundations of the World were laid, and his everlaſting purpoſe to deliver them from curſe, and to bring them to everlaſting Salvation, by the ſame Chriſt, in whom they were choſen.</hi> And I appeale to any reaſonable man whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this change doe offer any violence, or wrong to the words of the Article.</p>
                        <p>Now in good time commeth this terme <hi>(choſen in Chriſt)</hi> firſt to be examined, as that wherein lyeth the iſſue of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, Whether Chriſt was conſidered in the very act of chooſing his Elect? and full well did the Article keepe the words
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:64487:133"/>

To take from <hi>Arminius</hi> the envy of his Interpretation, hear what S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> long agoe wrote upon this place; <hi>Quod dicit, perinde est, ac ſic dicat, per quem nos benedixit per eundem &amp; elegit.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Quid eſt in ipſo elegit? per eam, quae in ipſo habenda eſſet, fidem; hoc praeſtitit pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſquam ipſi eſſemus, magis autem priuſquam mundi hujus jacerentur fundamenta.</hi> The Commentary aſcribed to S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> thus writeth upon the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians; Sicut elegit nos in ipſo: praeſcius Deus omnium ſcit qui credituri eſſent in Chriſtum, ſicut dicit ad Rom: Quos praeſcivit &amp; voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit non ſolum ex Iudaeis, ſed etiam ex Genti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi> So by theſe as purpoſe is according to Election, ſo Election is according to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 2. and foreknowledge of what? of Chriſt and faith in him.</p>
                        <p>And this was the common Opinion of the Fathers before S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> although they were not ignorant of the grace of God, nor of the ſuperiority of it, and power of it over all the infirmitie, and indignity of man.</p>

3. Conſider, that when theſe words, <hi>he hath choſen us in Chriſt,</hi> bee interpreted, <hi>Hee hath appointed us to Salvation to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in or by Christ,</hi> applying Chriſt to our obtaining Salvation by him, and not our Election and chooſing; marke, I ſay, our Article to deſpiſe this interpretation, when it plainly ſevers theſe two, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevereth them both diſtinct, <hi>to chooſe in Chriſt, and to bring to Salvation by Chriſt:</hi> So that Chriſt is as wel reſpected in our Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in our juſtification and glorificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which are things obtained to us by Chriſt: if therefore Election bee <hi>virtutis ſignum,</hi> as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith on <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Quis intentabit crimina adversùs Electos Dei?</hi> All that vertue which the choſen did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove was from Chriſt, in whom hee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted thoſe, whom hee found in him, not from faith, not from works, but from Chriſt, as it is in the cauſe of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                        <p>If it be objected, that by this the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of God is quite taken away, and his Juſtification is onely left him; for to take Believers is an act of Juſtice, and not of choiſe: I anſwer, that Election and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification differ not in this, that Faith in Chriſt is requiſite to Juſtification, but not to Election, but the difference lyeth in a
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:64487:135"/>
difference of time, though in both faith in Chriſt be requiſite. The difference in time is this: Before the Decree of God be paſt, or when the Decree is paſt, and gone out; while the Decree was in making, or was not yet determined, that which did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it and determine it, was choice and not juſtice; for then God is ſaid to have choſen Believers in Chriſt, becauſe when things were under deliberation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation what ſhould be done, choice had place and ſwayed all. But after the Decree is pronounced and eſtabliſhed, when God beholdeth a Believer as infallible <hi>futurum,</hi> then he juſtifyeth properly, and electeth him not: for his Election is already upon the infallibility of Gods foreknowledge, and the immutability of his Will. And this difference onely obſerved, the Doctrine of our Election in Chriſt doth ſtrongly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme our Faith of Juſtification and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by Chriſt, as our <hi>Article</hi> ſaith after: And our Juſtification by Chriſt doth much enlighten and cleare the Doctrine of our Election in Chriſt, according to the three <hi>Hypotheſes of Melancthon, loco de praede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinatione.</hi>

The Second Adjunct unto choſen is, that they were <hi>choſen out of Mankinde;</hi> Then by our <hi>Article</hi> all Mankinde was not choſen, but ſome out of Mankind; yet all Mankind was conſidered in the Omniſcience of God, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the firſt man to the laſt; for he that choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth out of all, muſt weigh and examine all.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Out of Mankinde,</hi> not out of Angells kinde; for ſeeing the Election is in Chriſt, and Chriſt tooke <hi>not hold of the nature of Angels,</hi> but of humane nature, the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt be out of humane kinde, as taken hold on by Chriſt<hi>:</hi> Chriſt being provided and Preached to humane kinde, as one Mediator betweene God and Man, <hi>The Man Chriſt Jeſus, who for us Men, and for our Salvation came down from Heaven and was incarnate.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Laſtly, if humane kinde bee it, out of which the Election is made, it muſt bee diſtributed into two parts; either as found in Chriſt, or as found out of Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Election is in Chriſt, therefore out of Mankinde as ſomething to doe with, or ſome relation to Chriſt: for if God in his Predeſtination had bent his conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration

unto the Maſſe of Mankinde inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and uncorrupted, there had hee found no man Reprobable, being that worke of his owne hand: If to the Maſſe of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde fallen, and corrupt, there had been found no man Eligible, all being under the curſe: But conſidering Mankinde as under Chriſt, that ſhould die for it, and ſhould be Preached to the World, there he found ſome eligible, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as laid hold on Chriſt by faith; and ſome reprobable, that being ſinners received not the Saviour that would be ſent to deliver them from curſe and condemnation. And thus much for the firſt act of God in the order of nature, (though the third thing mentioned in the letter of the Definition,) <hi>thoſe whom God hath choſen in Chriſt out of Mankinde.</hi>

                           <hi>in ipſum:)</hi> This let mee expreſſe in the words of <hi>Aleſius</hi> on <hi>John.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Cum filius Dei praevidiſſet genus humanum ruiturum in aeternum exitium propter peccatum, factus eſt ſupplex aeterno Patri (ecce interponente ſe hîc dilecto filio) ac promeruit Pater ei daret univerſos qui credituri eſſent in ipſum, ut eos ſervaret à tyrannide Diaboli, &amp; morte aeternâ.</hi> The Father never denyed the Son any thing which hee asked, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. <hi>Aske of me, and I ſhall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>So by this the interceſſion of Chriſt hath obtained all that beleeve in him to bee given to him, to deliver from curſe, and to bring to eternall Life and Salvation; not their faith, nor their works, but Chriſts favour with his Father.</p>
                        <p>The laſt thing in the Definition is an il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtration; the predeſtinated to Life are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted <hi>as Veſſells made to honour.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>This is taken out of S. <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 9. 21. where you ſhall finde the <hi>Veſſells made to honour,</hi> to be alſo called <hi>Veſſells of mercy,</hi> verſ. 23. and the <hi>Veſſells made to diſhonour</hi> called <hi>Veſſels of wrath,</hi> verſ. 22. but mercy and wrath doe both preſuppoſe ſin: Both ſo farre wide from the Apoſtle, and our <hi>Article,</hi> are the defenders of the firſt Opinion. What ſinne is it that is preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed?
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:64487:140"/>
That's now in the queſtion<hi>:</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Originall ſinne, or ſinne againſt Chriſt? It ſeemes by the Apoſtle, that <hi>Veſſels of Wrath</hi> were ſuch as <hi>God endured with much long-ſuffering,</hi> which being deſpiſed, hee then ſhewed his wrath and his power over them, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. which argued their ſinne to be impenitency. And <hi>Veſſels of Mercy</hi> to be ſuch, in whom he <hi>maketh knowne the riches of his Glory;</hi> but this is done in Chriſt above all, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 6. 7. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 20. the very viſible Church of Chriſt is the great houſe wherein are Veſſels, ſome to honour, ſome to diſhonour: But the whole Chapter, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. deſerves an eſpeciall ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boration, that together with the whole, the ſimilitude of the Potter and his lumpe, and his Veſſels might be openly cleared. The ſumme is;</p>
                        <p>That whereas the Salvation of all thoſe that are ſaved, and the perdition of all thoſe that periſh, is referred (as it ought to be) to the Will of God, to his mercy, to his love, to whom he will inlarged, and from whom he will reſtrained; and that there is no reſiſting, nor complaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Will: that then God and his Will is to be conſidered as it is by the Apoſtle, as the Univerſall and ſupreme Cauſe of all things, and as the generall
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:64487:141"/>
Mover, Governour, diſpoſer of them, through whoſe underſtanding, judgement and allowance they have all paſſed, and might have been otherwiſe diſpoſed, and other Events have proceeded out of them, if God had willed.</p>
                        <p>And againe, the Supreme Cauſe, as ſuch, muſt not onely be conſidered as the chiefe, and prime agent of things, or as alone do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all, but permitting other created Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to uſe their properties, faculties and freedomes, and to governe them and to uſe them to ſuch ends and uſes, as the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, his Juſtice, his Mercy, his Dominion ſhall judge fit to uſe them, and apply them, holily and righteouſly, and according to Gods Nature: God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in contemplation of his owne workes, which he himſelfe would doe, and of his creatures of free nature, what they would doe, (if he permit,) conceiving the iſſues would be diverſe, ſome good, ſome evill, out of his owne Soveraigne pleaſure and power, confirmed and ratified by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable decree thoſe iſſues, and their free cauſes that would bring them forth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he prepared ſome men to glory, ſome men to deſtruction as unto ends: but not without the intervent of their owne acts, as well as of his: who though he could have
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:64487:141"/>
mended or altered any of his own workes, or any of the other Creatures to other iſſues, yet hee would not, notwithſtanding hee knew that letting things goe thus the greateſt part of the Maſſe or multitude of Mankinde would goe into perdition; and but a few in compariſon would be tranſmitted to life and glory<hi>:</hi> yet he reſted in this purpoſe with as much blameleſſe liberty, as the <hi>Potter</hi> hath, who makes of the ſame lumpe of Clay veſſells for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable uſes, and veſſels for viler and baſer uſes: For although there ſeeme a great deale of neereneſſe betweene the <hi>Potter</hi> (as a man an owner) and his Clay, and there come but few things betweene the Will and power of the one, and the uſes and End of the other (as put caſe the apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and inaptneſſe of Clay to an end, which yet the <hi>Potter</hi> could mend if hee liſt by coſt and labour;) whereby the <hi>Potters</hi> power ſeemes to be more great and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute: yet it is moſt true, that there is a great deale more of neereneſſe betweene God and his Creature, and though there come many more things betweene the Will of God, and the End of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet is the infinite Knowledge, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and Power of God, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding theſe many more things inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:64487:142"/>
Gods Will is neerer to the End of his creatures, than the <hi>Potters</hi> Will can be to the End of his Clay, where ſo little or nothing come betweene. Thoſe then whom God choſe in Chriſt, and decreed to bring to Salvation by Chriſt, upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of his owne acts in giving Chriſt and his Spirit unto them, and upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of their acts in receiving Chriſt, and obeying his Spirit, theſe are Veſſells made unto honour. And againe, thoſe whom hee rejected, and decreed to bring into everlaſting deſtruction, upon ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of their acts in deſpiſing his Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and inabuſing his benefits given unto them, thoſe are Veſſels made to deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: There is a neceſſity of ſuch ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions here, becauſe the Maſſe of Mankinde is not like unto the Maſſe of <hi>Potters</hi> earth, rude, reaſonleſſe and ſenſeleſſe, but is a free Creature, whoſe nature is by the Ordinance of the Creator, to worke out and to procure to it ſelfe its owne End good or evill: good, by working accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God ſeeking that good to men, or evill, by declining from, or forſaking of God in his Worke, and ſo failing of God hee falls into evill: But becauſe God was able to have altered or amended the whole, or any peece of the Maſſe, which
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:64487:142"/>
happily the <hi>Potter</hi> is not alwayes able to doe in his Maſſe, therefore God muſt needs bee acknowledged to have a more excellent power over Mankinde his Maſſe, than any <hi>Potter</hi> hath of his Clay to make Veſſels to honour or diſhonour: whereby at laſt all is reſolved into the Will of God; but as it is the ſupreme and univerſall cauſe which doth allow all inferiour cauſes to move, and worke according to their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; which movings, and workings hee orders and applyes to his owne Glory of Juſtice, or Mercy, as ſeemeth agreeable to his Will. <hi>Vide Epiphan.

That to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> words <hi>called accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to purpoſe,</hi> the <hi>Article</hi> addeth, <hi>by his Spirit working in due ſeaſon, and they through grace obey the Calling:</hi> By which two ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions the <hi>Article</hi> declareth what <hi>Calling according to purpoſe is,</hi> viz. <hi>when Gods Spirit worketh in Calling,</hi> and not the outward word alone; and when <hi>by grace that Calling is obeyed:</hi> for theſe two are in the courſe and plot approved by God.</p>

                        <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Article</hi> intendeth the ſame thing which <hi>Melanchton</hi> ſayes S. <hi>Paul</hi> intended, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. <hi>Totum ordinem com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plecti voluit, quo Eccleſia condita eſt à</hi>

                           <hi>Deo:</hi> To the end that our Faith of eternall Salvation by Chriſt might bee eſtabliſhed and confirmed, ſince God hath contrived the whole courſe whereby hee will build his Church, that is, whereby hee will have on Earth a choſen Generation that ſhall inherit in Heaven everlaſting felicity. And this wee may certainly beleeve; becauſe the Knowledge of God which is infallible, his purpoſe which is unchangeable, his Calling according to purpoſe which cannot bee fruſtrate, his juſtifying which cannot be controuled, and his glory which is invincible, are all found in this order and courſe here ſet downe<hi>:</hi> beſides, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The Counſell of the Lord ſtandeth ſure, and the thoughts of his heart to all Generations,</hi> Pſal. 33. 11.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Secondly, whereas in this chaine there is one linke, which is put not onely as the firſt in order, but alſo as the cauſe and fountaine of all the reſt, which are not onely tyed to it, but derived from it, namely, <hi>the excellent benefit of our Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Predeſtination in Chriſt, which was given unto us by God, and ſettled upon us by his purpoſe before the Foundation of the World,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9. from whence doe flow all the lower bleſſings of Calling according to purpoſe, juſtifying, glorifying, as ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:64487:144"/>
as iſſues out of the firſt and higheſt. Therefore wee are bound <hi>to bleſſe God the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (as S. <hi>Paul</hi> doth,) <hi>who hath bleſſed us with all Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall bleſſings,</hi> viz. with calling, juſtifying, and <hi>according as hee hath choſen us in him, that wee ſhould be holy, and unblameable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him in love, Eph.</hi> 1. 3, 4. for the latter bleſſings doe call upon the firſt, not onely as a patterne, but as a Fountaine and root of them all. Now if it ſhould ſeeme ſtrange that thoſe ſhould be the Effects of Predeſtination, and yet bee foreknowne before Predeſtination, according as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſetteth Foreknowledge before Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Calling after it as the Effect, this doubt is cleered by the remembring that the foreknowledge that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of is that onely of Simple underſtanding, which is not the cauſe of any thing abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to bee, but onely as poſſible, or <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turum</hi> but <hi>ſub Hypotheſi,</hi> if the Will of God ſay it; and by remembring ſecondly, that the Will and Decree of God (wherein Predeſtination properly conſiſteth,) is onely the cauſe why any thing comes to act, and into being abſolutely, God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it to be indeed after that manner, as hee knew it might be before hee willed it to bee. So by this it is plaine that the
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:64487:145"/>
things which were the Objects of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding foreknowing them firſt as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, are after the Effects of the Will of God, when they are commanded by a Decree abſolutely to be, and to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to act: The knowledge of God being unto him a light and a guide; but his Will being to us the Fountaine of all our good, and the ground of the duties of thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Thirdly, whereas the lower linkes ſay, <hi>whom hee predeſtinated, hee called, &amp;c.</hi> we learne from hence, that the miniſtery of the Word, whereby the holy Ghoſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, juſtifyeth, ſanctifyeth the Elect people of God, chiefly intendeth the Execution of Predeſtination, according to S. <hi>Paul, Eph.</hi> 4. 12. <hi>That Paſtors and Teachers are given for the perfecting of the Saints, for the worke of the Miniſtery, for the Edifying of the Body of Chriſt; Non ergo alios, ſed quos praedeſtinavit, vocavit, juſticavit, ipſos glorificavit.

                        <p>From hence ſome doe teach Grace to flow from God by two Fountaines; by
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:64487:145"/>
the way of Preaching, or by the way of Gods Purpoſe, <hi>Carlton</hi> pag. 41. But it is certaine that the Graces which come from God by the way of Purpoſe, come alſo by the way of Preaching, and no other way without Preaching. But this is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> laying downe Gods Foreknowledge as the firſt linke of this Chaine that leadeth and guideth all; for though the generall love of God bee the Fountaine from whence the Preaching of the Word, Calling, and Promiſe of all Grace doe proceede, even to the very Elect, yet it being impoſſible for God to bee ignorant, or not to know the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of the Word Preached, or of his Calling, or of his Promiſe, who would obey and who not, it was impoſſible but hee reſting in them, and being content in their perſons, and in their number (though few) though otherwiſe contemptible, whom hee knew would beleeve, ſhould not as mainly intend their Salvation and their Calling, as if hee ſent his Word onely for them, and ſending his Word unto the reſt, as if hee held in, <hi>quaſi in ſe contineret,</hi> the knowledge of their diſobedience, would not by his Preſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hinder the Declaration and Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation of his good will to them. So that
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:64487:146"/>
by this the Preaching of the Word is the Fountaine of all Grace to them that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive grace, and might be alſo to them that receive it not; And Gods purpoſe, or Predeſtination out of foreknowledge is the Fountaine of Grace to them that have it, becauſe for their ſakes eſpecially it was that the word was ſent and Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And they which have not Grace, to whom the Word is Preached, want it not through the want of Predeſtination; but through their own neglect and diſdain; for had their obedience been foreknowne, they might have been <hi>ex praedeſtinatis:</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ever that <hi>Quos praeſcivit</hi> is aſmuch before <hi>praedeſtinavit,</hi> as <hi>quos praedeſtinavit</hi> is before <hi>vocavit.</hi>

                        <p n="4">4. Laſtly, we learne by the links of this chaine obſerved ſeverally, that whoſoever would know, whether he himſelfe be of the number of the Elect, he doe not fix his eye immediately upon either of theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, Predeſtination, and Glorification, but upon the middlemoſt (that be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween,) and try whether he be called, or whether he obeyed the call; whether he be juſtified, or made like to the Image of Gods onely Sonne, or walke religiouſly in all good works; theſe things if he finde, then may he truſt, that God hath Elected

                        <p>The whole paragraph conſiſteth of two propoſitions; the firſt beginneth here, <hi>As the godly conſideration of Predeſtination, &amp;c:</hi> The ſecond at, <hi>Furthermore, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The firſt Propoſition is long, and conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <hi>ex particulis relativis, quaehabent notas comparationis,</hi> expreſſed by the ſignes, <hi>Quemadmodum, Ita; As, So.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The ſecond period is ſhorter, but yet conſiſteth of a copulative propoſition, which is in ſubſtance two: One directing to receive Gods promiſes generally; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directing to follow in our doings that Will of God, which directly is expreſſed in the word of God.</p>
                        <p>The compariſon in the firſt period, is
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:64487:147"/>
laid between two unlike conſiderations of two different things, which produce two unlike effects in perſons of unlike quality, expreſſed in theſe words; <hi>As the godly conſideration of Predeſtination, and our Election in Chriſt is full of ſweet, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and unſpeakable comfort to godly perſons, and ſuch as feele in themſelves the working of the ſpirit of Chriſt, mortifying the works of the fleſh, and their earthly members, and drawing up their minds to high and heavenly things, as well becauſe it doth greatly eſtabliſh and confirme their faith of eternall Salvation to be enjoyed by Chriſt, as becauſe it doth fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently kindle their love towards God: So for curious and carnall perſons lacking the Spirit of Chriſt, to have continually before their Eyes the ſentence of Gods Predeſtination, is a moſt dangerous downfall, whereby the Devil doth thruſt them either into desperation, or into retchleſneſſe of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleane living, no leſſe perilous than desperation.</hi> So far the firſt period.</p>
                        <p>Out of the firſt part of this Compariſon we may conceive theſe inſtructions given us by the Church.</p>
                        <p n="1">1 That the conſideration of our Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination and Election in Chriſt, according to the Definition and doctrine in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer paragraph, is the onely Godly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:64487:147"/>
of predeſtination, and therefore ought to be uſed by all that will either teach or conſider this myſterie, not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider our Election without conſidering Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That this conſideration wherein Chriſt is had, is the fountaine of moſt ſweet, pleaſant and unſpeakable comfort; as indeed without Chriſt there can be no comfort to any child of <hi>Adam.</hi>

                        <p n="5">5. Laſtly, That the publiſhing of this doctrine of our Election in Chriſt is very juſtifiable and warrantable, becauſe to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe or with old ſo good an occaſion of confirming the faith, &amp; inflaming, the zeale of Godly men, would be a great injury to
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:64487:148"/>
them, and a great wrong to the grace of God.</p>
                        <p>Out of the ſecond part or reddition of this compariſon; ſo to curious and carnall men, we may conceive theſe cautions to be given as by the Church.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That to have continually before a mans eyes the ſentence of Predeſtination, is a different thing from the godly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Predeſtination in Chriſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. This ſentence is <hi>pernicioſiſſimum prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitium;</hi> is like ſome exceeding high and ſteep rock, which is dangerous for any man to ſtand upon, or to looke downe from; ſeeing from ſuch high downfalls the Devill uſeth to tempt men <hi>to throw themſelves down,</hi> as he did Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 6. and from this <hi>percipitium</hi> the Devill may thruſt men either into Deſpaire or Security.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That this having the Sentence of Predeſtination continually before their eyes, is the uſe and practice but of curious and carnall men, and ſuch as lack the Spirit of Chriſt, to whom alſo theſe evills doe betide of deſpaire and ſecurity; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this would be ſhunn'd and avoyded, as he that loves his ſafety would ſhun to walk upon, or gaze from ſome high and deep downfall.</p>
                        <p>One point in this compariſon needeth
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:64487:148"/>
ſome more full Explication, for it may be queſtioned, whether the Article meanes that theſe different Effects of comfort or downfall, doe proceed onely from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the perſons that doe conſider; being either pious or curious, carnall or ſpirituall, having the Spirit of Chriſt, or lacking the Spirit of Chriſt, or doe flow alſo from the difference of the things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, <hi>viz.</hi> either of Predeſtination or Election in Chriſt, or the ſentence of Gods Predeſtination?</p>
                        <p>There are that make no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene theſe two, and ſo to them the difference that the <hi>Article</hi> moteth muſt ariſe, onely from the difference of the perſons conſidering one and the ſame Doctrine of Predeſtination. But I may bee bold to put a difference betweene the things conſidered, aſwell as betweene the perſons conſidering, becauſe the <hi>Article</hi> doth ſo: <hi>ſo for curious and carnall perſons &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Article</hi> doth not ſay it is a dangerous downefall, namely the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Predeſtination and Election in Chriſt, as keeping the ſame ſubject whereof hee had ſpoken before as comfortable; but it ſubſtituteth another ſubject, <hi>to have continually before their Eyes the Doctrine of Gods Predeſtination:</hi> that is a dangerous
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:64487:149"/>
downefall, and not the other. And to mee it ſhould ſeeme incredible that either the <hi>Article</hi> ſhould ſay, or that Doctor <hi>Bancroft</hi> ſhould ſay, That the ſound, full and whole Doctrine of Predeſtination and our Election in Chriſt (ſuch as is here delivered in the former paragraph,) ſhould be a dangerous downfall even to carnall men, and even them that lack the Spirit of Chriſt. For although it be true that the fruit and comfort of this, and many other Divine truths bee reaped onely by godly perſons when they are come to have the Spirit of Chriſt, &amp;c. And it be true alſo that our curioſity and carnall affections bee great impediments to the right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and judging of Divine truths; yet it is as true that every neceſſary Doctrine is in ſacred Scripture ſo fully, perfectly, and coherently delivered, and ought to be therefore fitly deduced by the Church, that of it ſelfe it have no aptneſſe to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>praecipitium</hi> even to carnall men, and ſuch as have not the Spirit of Chriſt, ſince the Scripture was not written to be reade onely of them that doe already in humility beleeve it, and are filled with the Spirit of Chriſt, but even by naturall men having onely ordinary humane judgements, and to taſte of the things of God.</p>

What then is it that the Article ſaith, hath ſo much as a likelyhood of a downfall to the curious and carnall?

                        <p>But this forme of teaching ſeemes to me at leaſt new and ſtrange, to preſume that at the very firſt, which is the laſt thing we attaine unto after long exerciſe in goodneſſe; namely, To believe that we are predeſtinated unto life, whereof we have neither promiſe nor ſigne at the firſt entrance into Chriſtianity<hi>: Quantò rectius hic qui nihil molitur ineptè. Sanctus Paulus ad Rom.</hi> 10. 9. <hi>This is the word of Faith which we preach, that if thou ſhalt confeſſe with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus, and ſhalt beleeve with thy heart that God raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning is, that the firſt thing we owe to God, is, to believe the generall promiſe, out of which we cannot exclude our ſelves; if <hi>thou beleeve and confeſſe thou ſhalt be ſaved;</hi> unleſſe I interpret <hi>Bucers credere,</hi> in a more large manner, that I believe it poſſible I may be one of the Elect; under hope I will try and heare what God will work, as he <hi>that ploweth ploweth in hope; (<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicuique agendum in spe,</hi> ſaith Doctor <hi>Abbot, Sariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bur. pag.</hi> 141.) but this is farre from the Faith <hi>Bucer</hi> ſpeakes of God.

by Chriſt, and the generall promiſes of the Goſpel?</p>
                        <p>This is that net, which the Fiſher of men ſpread over all men to draw them on to God: If I once ſurmiſe or ſuſpect that God intends to draw by the Goſpell, or to gather to himſelfe but ſome few ſpeciall particulars, whom hee hath marked out, I begin preſently to trembly, fearing I may be none of them, ſeeing the number is but ſmall, and it is eaſier to bee found among the many, than one of the few.</p>
                        <p>When the Lord ſaid to the twelve, <hi>One of you ſhall betray mee;</hi> Every one began to feare and ſuſpect himſelfe, when yet there was but one of twelve that ſhould doe the thing: How much more may men feare, when it is ſaid, Faith is the Gift of God, and this hee giveth but to the Elect, which are few in compariſon of thoſe that have it not? this way leades mee to diſcomfort or deſpaire, or at leaſt it taketh away from mee all remorſe for unbeliefe and impenitence<hi>:</hi> for if God giveth mee not Faith and Repentance, and that out of his Decree by which he determined not to give it, but to ſome few, I cannot doe withall, nor helpe it, if I have not Faith.</p>

                        <p>The laſt Caveat or direction is not much different from the former<hi>: That in our doings, that Will of God is to be followed, which wee have expreſly declared unto us in the Word:</hi> for this Doctrine ariſeth from the true and neceſſary diſtinction of the Will of God, which is <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 29. into <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>revealed,</hi> and that of the Schoole into <hi>Signi &amp; Beneplaciti;</hi> which ſome abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, by thinking that God may have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will ſecret and different about the ſame thing, whereof hee hath a declared and revealed Will: or that which is ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is leſſe pleaſing than that which is ſecret, called <hi>Beneplaciti;</hi> doe forſake or neglect his Will revealed, to fulfill his Will ſecret, which they count to be his onely Will.</p>
                        <p>As in this preſent matter<hi>:</hi> when the Word of God revealeth it to be the Will of God, that every hearer of the Goſpell doe repent, beleeve and be ſaved; ſome man granting this to be Gods revealed Will, and ſignifyed Will, may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding imagine that God hath another ſecret Will, and that of his good Pleaſure,
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:64487:154"/>
which ſhall ſtand, not to have him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, nor to beleeve, nor to be ſaved: And this imagination is commonly foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Doctrine of Predeſtination, which excludeth Preſcience, and makes God to proceede immediatly to his Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, upon the conſideration of the fall of Mankinde.</p>
                        <p>But againſt this, our Article adviſeth to follow in our doings the Will of God declared in his Word; and this it doth not onely by way of advice, as if it were at our liberty, and onely the beſt and ſafeſt way, but even out of neceſſary grounds: For,</p>
                        <p n="1">1. Firſt, That which is ſecret and hidden can be to us no certaine ground to build upon, for who knowes God will not give him leave to repent, beleeve, or bee ſaved?</p>
                        <p n="2">2. That there can be no ſecret Will of God, contrary to his revealed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Will; for this were to make God a Lyer: but even theſe two ſecret and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed have two divers Objects; or of one Object, yet divers times wherein they are placed: As for Example, That there ſhall bee a day of judgement, is the revealed Will of God, but when that day ſhall be, is ſecret to us, though determined and

knowne to God: theſe be two Objects, that a day ſhall be, and when that day ſhall bee.</p>
                        <p>Againe, the Goſpell of our Salvation before the World was, was a ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell and Will of God; but ſince the World was, it hath beene revealed and opened to the Prophets and Apoſtles, and is no more hidden but manifeſted: the ſame thing in both, but in two times, in the one hidden, in the other revealed: being well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing unto God, while it was ſecret; and not ceaſed to be ſo, being ſignifyed and declared to the ſons of men.</p>

                  <p>I like and love the heate of your Zeale, onely I deſire in it a little more mixture of cooling Charity; I verily beleeve your zeale to be true, but you ſhall give mee leave to tell you, that (in very many) that
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:64487:161"/>
which is ſo called, is indeed, but an angry, unmercifull Paſſion; and (that I may ſpeak plainly, and name things as they are, <hi>Scapham, Scapham)</hi> a pure pang mixt of Pride and Ignorance. It appeares by the whole Tenour of your Letter, that you are affected with a ſtrong ſuſpition, that I am turn'd <hi>Arminian;</hi> And you further gueſſe at the motive, that ſome ſprinkling of Court-holy-water, like an Exorciſme, hath enchanted or conjur'd mee into this new ſhape: How loth am I to underſtand your meaning? and how faine would I put a faire interpretation upon theſe foule paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages (if they were capable)! what man! not an <hi>Arminian</hi> onely, but hyred into that Faith by carnall hopes? one that can value his Soule at ſo poore a Rate, as to ſell it to the times, or weigh or ſway his conſcience with Money? My good friend, how did you thus forget mee, and your ſelfe? and the ſtrict charge of our Maſter, <hi>Judge not?</hi> well; you have my pardon, and God Almighty confirme it unto you with his. But to prevent your errour, and ſinne, in this kinde hereafter, I deſire you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that, I neither am, nor ever will be, <hi>Arminian;</hi> I am reſolved to ſtand faſt in that Liberty, which my Lord hath ſo dearly bought for me.</p>

In Divine Truths my conſcience cannot ſerve men, or any other Maſter, beſides him, who hath his Chaire in Heaven: I love <hi>Calvin</hi> very well, and, I muſt tell you I cannot hate <hi>Arminius;</hi> and for my part, I am verily perſwaded, that theſe two are now where they agree well, in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Heaven; whilſt ſome of their Paſſionate Diſciples are ſo eagerly braw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling here on Earth; I ſhould honour Truth, if I heard it out of the Popes mouth, or the Devills; nor can I believe a falſity, though publiſhed by an Angell; I prize my ſoule ſo dearely, that I dare not venture it upon any mans credit, or take upon truſt any opinion which may endanger it; nor can the worth of all this world perſwade me, in matters of Faith, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine or beleeve any Concluſion, which I finde not to iſſue from Premiſſes of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or Reaſon; But moſt eſpecially, I tremble to think or ſpeak any thing of God Almighty, which hath not expreſſe warrant in his owne word; and ſo much the more, if it ſeeme injurious or diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable to that moſt glorious and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Deity. For my life, I cannot obtaine of my conſcience to declame, and revile, and cry downe an opinion, when I cannot ſee any ſolid ſatisfying anſwer to many
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:64487:162"/>
contrary Scriptures and Reaſons; It is a very eaſie way which many walke, and if it were as ſafe, I would be content to walk it with them; Blind-folded they follow their leaders, &amp; ſparing their own eyes, they preſume their guides (ſo learned, ſo holy) ſee clearly enough. Therefore they beleeve all their Dictates (as if they were divinely inſpired, and ſpake Oracles) without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, which eaſes them of much trouble and difficulty in ſifting and judging. For my part, I ever thought it a thing unworthy of a Chriſtian, (and yet more of a Miniſter) and full of Danger, to invaſſall his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to any man, or any men; or to embrace and eſpouſe opinions in Religion, without judgement, out of fantafie and prejudice, becauſe they are recommended by ſome great names, which we have in Admiration. But becauſe you are my friend, I will yet farther reveale my ſelfe unto you; I have labour'd long and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently in theſe controverſies, and I will tel you with what minde and method, and with what ſucceſſe.</p>
                  <p>For ſome yeares in my youth, when I was moſt ignorant, I was moſt confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; before I knew the true ſtate or any grounds of theſe queſtions, I could pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily reſolve them all; and upon
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:64487:162"/>
every occaſion, in the very Pulpit, I was girding and railing upon theſe new Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques the <hi>Arminians;</hi> and I could not finde words enough to decipher the folly and abſurdity of their Doctrine; Eſpecially, I abhorred them as venemous enemies of the Precious Grace of God, whereof I ever was, and ever will bee, moſt jealous and tender, as I am moſt obliged, holding all I am, or have, or hope for, by that glorious grace<hi>:</hi> yet all this while, I tooke all this that I talkt, upon truſt, and knew not what they ſaid, or thought, but by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from others; and from their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; And, becauſe my conſcience in ſecret would often tell mee that rayling would not carry it in matters of Religion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon and Divine Authority; that I might now ſolidly maintaine Gods Truth (as it becomes a Miniſter) out of Gods Word, and clearly vindicate it from wicked exceptions; And that I might not onely revile and ſcratch the adverſary, but beate and wound him, and fight it out, <hi>fortibus armis, non ſolùm fulgentibus,</hi> I betooke my ſelfe ſeriouſly and earneſtly to peruſe the writings of both parties, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and ballance the Scriptures produced for both Opinions.</p>
                  <p>But my aime in this inquiry, was not
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:64487:163"/>
to informe my ſelfe, whether held the Truth (for therein I was extremely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, preſuming it was with us, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the oppoſers with prejudice and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation) but the better to fortifie our Tenets againſt their Cavills and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties.</p>
                  <p>In the meane while knowing that all light and illumination in Divine Myſteries, deſcends from above, from the Father and Fountaine of all light, without whoſe influence and inſtruction, all our ſtudies are moſt vaine and frivolous; I reſolved conſtantly and dayly to ſollicite my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God, with moſt ardent ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (as I ſhall ſtill continue) that hee would bee pleaſed to keepe his poore ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant in his true faith and feare; that hee would preſerve mee from all falſe and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous errors, how Specious or Plauſible ſoever; that hee would fill my heart with true Holineſſe and Humility, empty it of all Pride, Vaine-glory, Curioſity, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp;c. all other carnall conceits, and Affections, which uſually blinde and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the judgement; That hee would give mee the grace to renounce and deny my fooliſh Reaſon in thoſe holy ſtudies, and teach mee abſolutely to captivate my thoughts to the obedience of his heavenly
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:64487:163"/>
Word; finally that he would not permit me to ſpeak or think any thing, but what were conſonant to his Scriptures, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and glorious to his Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>I dare never looke upon my Bookes, till I have firſt looked up to Heaven with theſe Prayers; Thus I begin, thus I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and thus conclude my ſtudies; In my ſearch my firſt and laſt reſolution was, and is, to beleeve onely what the Lord tells me in his Booke; And, becauſe all men are lyars, and the moſt of men factious, to mark not what they ſay, but what they prove; Though I muſt confeſſe I much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured my owne ſide, and read what was written againſt it, with exceeding indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſpecially when I was pinched, and found many objections to which I could finde no Anſwers; Yet in ſpight of my Judgement my Conſcience ſtood as it could; and ſtill multiplying my Prayers, and recurring to my Oracle, I repelled ſuch thoughts, as Temptations<hi>:</hi> Well, in this perplexity I went on, and firſt obſerv'd the Judgements of this age, ſince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; And here I found in the very Harmony of our Confeſſions, ſome little diſcord in theſe opinions, but generally and the moſt part of our Reformed Churches favouring the <hi>Remonſtrants:</hi> and
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:64487:164"/>
among particular writers many here diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in Judgements, though linked in affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and all of them eminent for learning and Piety; and being all buſied againſt the common adverſary, the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> theſe little differences amongſt themſelves, were wiſely neglected and concealed. At length ſome of our owne gave occaſion (I feare) to theſe inteſtine and wofull warres, letting fall ſome ſpeeches very ſcandalous, and which cannot be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This firſt put the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches in a freſh Alarum againſt us, and imbittred their hatred; and now, that which was but a queſtion, is made a quarrell; that which before was fairly and ſweetly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated betweene private Doctours, was now become an appeale to contention betweene whole reformed Churches, they in one army, we in the other; But ſtill the moſt wiſe and holy in both parties, deſired a Peace, and ceaſed not to cry with teares, <hi>Sirs, ye are Brethren, why doe ye ſtrive?</hi> and with all their Power laboured, that both the Armies might be joyned under the Prince of Peace againſt the Pope and the Devill.</p>
                  <p>But whileſt theſe laboured for Peace, there never wanted ſome eager ſpirits, that made all ready for warre, and whoſe nailes
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:64487:164"/>
were ſtill itching till they were in the wounds of the Church; for they could not beleeve they had any zeale, unleſſe they were furious; nor any Faith unleſſe they wanted all Charity: and by the wicked diligence of thoſe <hi>Boutefeus,</hi> that ſmall ſparke, which at firſt a little moderation might have quenched, hath now ſet us all in a woefull fire, worthy to be lamented with teares of Blood.</p>
                  <p>For the late <hi>Arminians,</hi> wee ſay, they are fled, and they ſay, they are chaſed from us to the <hi>Lutherans:</hi> wee accuſe them of Sedition, Hereſie and Schiſme; they often proteſt deeply before God Almighty (how truely, <hi>ipſe viderit &amp; judicet,)</hi> that out of meere tenderneſſe of conſcience, and zeale to Piety and Gods Glory, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a moderation in ſome rigorous opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; But however a mutuall toleration of one anothers Errors and infirmities, ſtill keeping the ligament of Chriſtian commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and fraternity inviolable.</p>
                  <p>They complaine, that in the late Synod things were carryed very unequally; That Truth was not ſought, but Victory; That their profeſſed enemies were their Judges; That the Scriptures and Reaſons (ſince publiſhed in the <hi>Scripta Synodica)</hi> were not throughly examined, and ſo their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:64487:165"/>
convicted; That they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but not confuted; That now they reſt worſe ſatisfied, than before; That thoſe, which before were but private opinions, and diſputable Problemes, and ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted, are now made neceſſary truthes, and Canoniz'd deciſions; And they ſay withall, that this hath beene the Prime cauſe of all Schiſmes and ruptures in the Church in all ages, That matters of Faith and matters of Opinion have not beene exactly diſtinguiſhed, but the one obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Tyranny upon the Conſcience for the other.</p>
                  <p>They aske whether we think our firſt Reformers (like the Pope) infallible? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was not poſſible for them to erre? whether it were not ingenuous to confeſſe and correct a fault, when we are told of it? But, Principally next after the Bible, they inſiſt with great boldneſſe upon their appeale to venerable antiquity, which they challenge entirely to ſide with them. All the Greek and Latine Doctours for ſix hundred yeares after the Apoſtles, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving expreſly declared themſelves againſt us, and many of them in whole Treatiſes of Purpoſe; onely Saint <hi>Anſtine,</hi> they ſay, ſeemes to favour us, with his two diſciples, <hi>Proſper</hi> and <hi>Fulgentius;</hi> and yet they onely
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:64487:165"/>
in the firſt Point, concerning the <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Decree of Election;</hi> yet therein ſpeaking variouſly and uncertainly; In the reſt, concerning the <hi>Death of Chriſt, and, Perſeverance of all the faithfull,</hi> they clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make for them.</p>
                  <p>You will aske mee what I ſay of this; I muſt confeſſe theſe Reaſons have convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mee, not ſo farre as abſolutely to yeeld unto them, or take part with them in any Faction, (you need not feare mee for that) but ſo farre, as not raſhly to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, damne or Anathematize them, Till I can ſee their pretenſions voided; But I was eſpecially netled with their confident appeale to Antiquity. For let mee tell you, Nature hath planted in mee a very great Opinion and Reverence of thoſe Ancient Worthies, which were as farre before us in true Devotion and Piety, as they are in time<hi>:</hi> and which the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Church of Chriſt, hath ever juſtly honoured, as her fathers. And though I know them to have erred as men, and will never make them the Rule of my Faith, yet I abhorre to thinke that they ſhould live and die and concurre in any dangerous or damnable Opinion; wherefore I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſift this allegation to the Bottome, and impartially to enquire into their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:64487:166"/>
Many of my houres for theſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares laſt paſt, have beene ſpent upon theſe venerable Doctors, and I have with fruit and fidelity, collected out of many of them, many good and wholeſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
                  <p>Upon this occaſion, I betooke my ſelfe to my Notes and Exceptions, and, in truth, found nothing in them that favoured thoſe Opinions that I favoured; I obſerved many ſhrewd and pertinent paſſages al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged by the <hi>Arminians,</hi> even out of S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Prosper,</hi> and upon triall found their Quotations very faithfull; Eſpecially <hi>Voſſius</hi> in his <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hiſtory, hath with great learning and diligence diduced the judgement of all Antiquity in all theſe Controverſies; yet I ſuſpected him as a Partiſan, till I was better inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome that knew him well; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, by your owne moſt worthy, learned, godly and reverend Father, the late <note n="*" place="margin">Doctor <hi>Carleton.</hi>
                     </note> Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter,</hi> with whom having ſome private Conference in <hi>London,</hi> ſome two yeares ſince, at his Lodging in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> among other good Diſcourſe wee fell in talke of that man, and I humbly deſired his Lordſhips judgement, whether hee were an <hi>Arminian</hi> or no? Hee anſwered mee, that hee was no <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi>
                     <pb n="423" facs="tcp:64487:166"/>
but a very honeſt man; and among other Synodiſts hee beſtowed a Coppy of his Booke upon him: Since that, himſelfe hath aſſured mee, that the good Biſhop ſpoke true; for hee hath declared himſelfe in his laſt Booke, <hi>De Scriptoribus Latinis,</hi> to be of Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> minde in theſe queſtions, and is allowed by the States pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Profeſſor at <hi>Leyden,</hi> where no <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> is tolerated; of him I will ſay no more but this; They that know the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and judgement of that man, by his workes, will confeſſe that there lives not this day in <hi>Europe,</hi> any one more learned; and by the relation of ſome Perſons of credit, and ſince that, by himſelfe, when hee was with me of late in <hi>Oxford,</hi> I knew, that when the miſerable Schiſme was at the hotteſt in thoſe Countries, hee never ſided with either Faction, but would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire to both their Churches and Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, to teſtifie that he meant to keepe Peace with both.</p>
                  <p>But now you long to heare what is the iſſue of all my ſtudy and enquiry, what my reſolution; why? you may eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture; finding upon this ſerious ſearch that all doubts are not clearly decided by Scripture; that in the ancient Church, after the age of S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who was preſently
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:64487:167"/>
contradicted by many Catholiques, (as you may ſee in the Epiſtles of <hi>Prosper</hi> and <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentius</hi> to him, upon that very occaſion) they have ever beene friendly debated, and never determined in any Councill; that in our age, whole Churches are here divided, either one from another, as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> from us; or amongſt themſelves, as the <hi>Romaniſts,</hi> amongſt whom the <hi>Dominican</hi> Family is wholy for the <hi>Remonstrants;</hi> that in all theſe ſeverall Churches ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Doctors vary in theſe Opinions. Out of all this I collect for my Part that the Points are no neceſſary catholique verities; not eſſentiall to the Faith, but meerely mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Opinion, Problematicall, of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour moment, wherein a man may erre or be ignorant without danger to his Soule, yet ſo ſtill that the glory of Gods Juſtice, Mercy, Truth, Sincerity and Divine grace be not any wayes blemiſhed, nor any good aſcribed to mans corrupt will, or any evill to Gods Decree or Providence; wherein I can aſſure you, I doe not depart from my ancient judgement, But doe well remember what I affirmed in my Queſtions at the Act, and have confirmed it I ſuppoſe in my Sermon.</p>

                  <p>So you ſee, I am ſtill where I was; If I can clearly diſcover any errour or corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in my ſelfe or any other, I ſhould hate it with all my might; But pity, ſupport and love all that love the <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> though they erre in doubtfull Points; but never break Charity, unleſſe with him that obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately erres in fundamentalls, or is wilfully factious; and with this moderation, I dare with confidence and comfort enough, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare before my Lord at the laſt day; when I feare what will become of him that loves not his brother; that Divine precept of love being ſo often ingeminated, why may I not when the Lord himſelfe hath aſſured me, by his <hi>Beati Pacifici?</hi> you tell me of a Deane, that ſhould ſay, <hi>Maledicti Pacifici;</hi> but you and hee ſhall give me leave in this contradiction, rather to beleeve my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
                  <p>My loving friend, I do very much eſteem your learning and judgement, and am ſo much the more confirmed by your Letter,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:64487:168"/>
in my moderation; for you doe oppoſe it with a very good courage, but not with ſo good ſucceſſe; All the Reaſons, which I have couched in my Sermon, ſtand ſtill very firme, all unſhaken, and almoſt all untouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; For my part I honour Truth with all my heart, next after God, or rather as I doe God himſelfe, who is the God of Truth; and I ſhall eſteeme him my deareſt friend, that ſhall at any time conquer my errours with evidence of Truth; for that conqueſt ſhall be my happineſſe and victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Any errour abuſeth the underſtanding, but an errour in Religion corrupts it, in Faith poiſon it; How happy and glad ſhall I be to be purged of all ſuch ruſt and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon! But I am a Chriſtian, and rationall, and ſtill I muſt repeat it, I cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed but with Scripture or reaſon; either of theſe (the latter being grounded on the former) will command my aſſent; but <hi>I</hi> cannot be chidden, or frighted, or forced into an Opinion; one good Argument ſwayes mee more, than twenty Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations.</p>
                  <p>Falſehood is fearefull, and loves to goe diſguiſed, to walke in a miſt, and becauſe it ſmels ill, to be trimmed with all the flowers of Rhetorique: Truth hates no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than Maſquing; ſhee loves and
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:64487:168"/>
longs to appeare in her naked, native Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and after the moſt rigorous, ſcrupulous examination, remaines ſtill the ſame. Let me entreat you to looke over againe that Paſſage of my Sermon, which offends you; marke well what I ſay, and upon what grounds. See whether my Margent doe not make good every Particularity in the <hi>Text</hi> (where it is doubtfull) by particular and pertinent authorities. After tryall, if you pleaſe to informe mee where I have faulted, I doe here ſeriouſly promiſe you, to caſt the firſt ſtone at my ſelfe, and to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh my owne Retractation, after the moſt imitable patterne (but never yet imitated) of the moſt learned and modeſt Biſhop of <hi>Hippo;</hi> But if you will without Reaſon, <note place="margin">S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine.</hi>
                     </note> without fault reject and reprobate my Opinion, <hi>Ex mero beneplacito, ex abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutâ voluntate,</hi> (as you know who ſayes, that God Almighty did with the moſt part of innocent Mankinde) this I cannot thinke of you my Learned, Wife, Juſt and Mercifull Friend.</p>
                  <p>You ſay the <hi>Arminians</hi> are Heretiques, we may not be at Peace with them; The matters controverted are fundamentall, eſſentiall: To this I need ſay no more, for I have ſaid enough in this Letter, and in my Sermon to prove the contrary; and I
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:64487:169"/>
doubt not, your ſecond thoughts will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade you to unſay it; If you perſiſt, then let me tell you, all the Learned in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of our owne Party, even the late Doctors of the Synod, are your Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and very lately (as I have heard) in the Low Countries, a learned Synod of <hi>Contra-Remonſtrants,</hi> did purpoſely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute this Point, and conclude with my aſſertion; giving other reaſons, why the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> remaine baniſhed; And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of many Arguments, I will leave you one, whereon to meditate, which likewiſe makes very much for my maine intentions. The <hi>Arminians</hi> diſſent from us onely in theſe foure queſtions<hi>:</hi> The <hi>Lutheran</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches maintaine againſt us, all theſe foure queſtions, and moreover a number of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table dreames and Dotages, both in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ceremony and doctrine; amongſt others, you remember their abſurd <hi>ubiquity,</hi> and <hi>conſubſtantiation;</hi> Now, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their foule corruptions, yet I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume you know (for its apparent out of publique records) that our better-reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Churches in <hi>England, France, Germany,</hi> &amp;c. by the advice of their worthieſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours, <hi>Calvin, Bucer, Beza, Martyr, Zan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin, Pareus,</hi> have ſtill offered to the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> all Chriſtian Amity, Peace, and
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:64487:169"/>
Communion; and deſired them, conjur'd them, to joyne all together the right hands of Fellowſhip; though thoſe virulent fiery Adders of <hi>Saxony</hi> would never give eare to the voice of thoſe wiſe charmers; But profeſſe to this day, a perpetuall foehood, and immortall Hoſtility againſt us; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in <hi>Polonia,</hi> the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts,</hi> being of a better Temper, have long lived in a heavenly and brotherly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and communion, both of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining their old opinions. Now ſay good Maſter <hi>V.</hi> what think you? doe the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> erre fundamentally, or not? if ſo, then they have no union with God, nor connexion with Chriſt the head; with what Conſcience then could our Churches and worthies, offer them their Communion, and deſire it? If not, how then doth the <hi>Arminian</hi> erre fundamentally, ſince the <hi>Lutheran</hi> maintaines the ſame Opinion with many more and worſe? And againe, with what Conſcience can the <hi>Arminian</hi> (properly <hi>quà talis)</hi> be rejected out of our Communion, when the <hi>Lutheran</hi> (who is as bad, and farre worſe) is invited to it, and would very joyfully be admitted? Solve me this Riddle, but Solve me it ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantially and Solidly, <hi>Et eris mihi magnus Apollo.</hi> You tell me <hi>Beza</hi> calls <hi>Origens</hi>
                     <pb n="430" facs="tcp:64487:170"/>
errour <hi>turpiſſimum errorem,</hi> (but by the way, thats not latine for a damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie) and that <hi>Sixtus Senenſis</hi> when he had muſtred his Fathers, rejects their Opinion, and you aske me what I thinke of <hi>Trew</hi> and <hi>Careleſſe</hi> in the booke of Martyrs; All this very impertinently; In that place I enquire not what <hi>Beza,</hi> or <hi>Calvin,</hi> or <hi>Sixtus ſenenſis</hi> thought, nor whether the old Fathers were deceived; theſe enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were not to my purpoſe; But can you deny but that theſe writers teſtifie, that many learned, pious, catholique Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of the old Church taught <hi>Praedeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for foreſeene faith or works?</hi> And ſuppoſe them herein to have erred (as for my part I doubt not but they did, though upon other grounds, than the bare aſſertion of <hi>Calvin, Beza,</hi> or <hi>Senenſis,)</hi> yet can you deny that notwithſtanding this errour and others, they were then, and ſtill ſince, accompted holy catholique Biſhops? Doe you not beleeve them to be with God? and thinke you not, as I doe, that whoſoever ſhould involve them in a capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cenſure, (as none of your Authors doe, but ſpeak reverently of them all,) ſhould be groſſely and wickedly uncharitable? Grant me but theſe things, which none can deny, and I deſire no more, I have
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:64487:170"/>
enough to make good my words.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Trew</hi> and <hi>Careles,</hi> it ſeemes you thinke <hi>Trew</hi> was <hi>Careles,</hi> and <hi>Careles</hi> was <hi>Trew.</hi> And to tell you my mind, I think ſo too. But remember this, that both of them were Martyrs (or Confeſſors,) and ſo neither erred fundamentally. By conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, my diſcourſe is true, yours againe impertinent; But the <hi>Arminians</hi> conſpire with the <hi>Romaniſts; Ergo,</hi> no Peace, no truce with either; I will pleade for neither of them, but for my ſelfe. Firſt, the ground of your inference is weake. Excuſe me, if I cannot reject an Opinion, <hi>eo ipſo</hi> (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out farther conviction than onely) becauſe they of <hi>Rome</hi> approve of it; For what? doe not they, and doe not we with them anathematize the <hi>Anti-trinitarians, Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Neſtorians, Eutichians?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if you looke againe into your Bookes, and conſider well, you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes more againſt the <hi>Arminians,</hi> than for them. The prime controverſie, (on which all the other are but Appendences) is that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Abſolute irreſpective Decre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

obſerve and See, whether they all (and many more) doe not ſtrongly ſwim in the ſtreame after <hi>Auſtine;</hi> And the truth is, our firſt reformers did herein but ſay over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine thoſe Leſſons, which they had learned in the <hi>Roman</hi> Schooles; And the hardeſt paſſages that have fallen from <hi>Calvin,</hi> or <hi>Piſcator,</hi> may eaſily be Parallell'd with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as Rigorous, in many <hi>Romiſh</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours; eſpecially of late yeares, the whole <hi>Dominican</hi> familie have beene zealous and voluminous in theſe queſtions, which they call, <hi>de Auxiliis;</hi> wherein though they ſweat to ſever their Opinion from the <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> (as they call us) yet ſome <hi>Jeſuites</hi> tell them (and very truly) that their labour is very vaine and ridiculous; Among the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> themſelves, the more Ancient, <hi>Tollet, Bellarmine, Valentia, Suarez,</hi> doe not in effect diſſent from the <hi>Dominicans:</hi> onely ſome few new ones, <hi>Molina, Leſſius,</hi> and take up the Bucklers againſt them, and bid them Battell, but in very faire and friendly manner; for they try it in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conflict, not as we doe, with Paſſionate and mutuall revilings, but with reaſons and arguments, <hi>&amp; Salvâ ſemper charitate;</hi> For ſo they are commanded by their great Dictator at <hi>Rome,</hi> who indeed dares not otherwiſe decide the Doubts, leſt the

                  <p>It is high time to eaſe both you and my ſelfe (for ſurely we are both weary) of this tedious Letter; I will draw to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; I hold all neceſſary verities to be clearly revealed in Gods divine Booke, and therein abhorre all <hi>Pyrrhonian</hi> ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: For he is an <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> that will not beleeve God Almighty when he ſpeakes; I conſtantly beleeve all Scripture to be an heavenly Truth, though I cannot compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it with my Reaſon; I Beleeve like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we ſhall know much more in Heaven, than we can doe on Earth; I reſolve never to be an <hi>Arminian,</hi> and ever to be moderate.
